Madam President, the President of the European Central Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, recently said that, when the market stabilises, we will not return to business as usual, but instead we will experience a new normality.
Given the failings and weaknesses in the market and institutions that have been brought to light in devastating fashion over the last year, a move away from the abuses and faults of the past is only to be welcomed.
The financial crisis has caused terrible panic, but it has also served to emphasise the need to eliminate obscurities and to introduce transparency, and for we legislators to regulate.
But we also must avoid panic, because if we panic we will make poor decisions.
In the US, out of the scramble to avert catastrophe, radical alterations to the landscape of high finance are emerging.
Our institutions have stood steadier than those in the States – understandably as the crisis originated across the Atlantic – yet certain cases are a reminder that we are in no way invulnerable.
To ensure the stability of our markets in the future, we must implement structural and systematic reforms and be prepared to act quickly.
There may be three things that will happen or have happened already, such as reforms – for example ensuring that central banks prevent runs on banks and financial institutions – and there has been significant action in this regard already.
Secondly, treasuries must remove the reason for runs occurring in the first place, namely the presence of distressed assets in the balance sheets of financial institutions.
Lastly, it is pivotal for the financial system to be recapitalised.
We have passed the initial stages of the crisis.
The effects on banking and the political response to this initial trauma will not be known for some time.
However, we now have to face up to ensuring that the new financial reality that emerges from the other end of this crisis is a strong and healthy one.
To this end, it is necessary to address the root of the crisis and to remove distressed assets and clean up balance sheets.
To emerge from the quagmire of the crisis, it is also necessary, for both localised and global economic health, to show there is sufficient capital in the finance system.
Whether this is from public or private injection or a combination of both is another discussion, but we must have one soon.
We do not know yet what the full and lasting impact of the world ’ s financial crisis and its consequences on European markets will be.
However, what we do know is that, to emerge standing from this crisis and to be sure that investors, markets and citizens are protected in the new normality that will result, we must keep our heads – even in time of doubt and turmoil –
and take concrete steps towards implementing structural and systematic reforms that will safeguard the health of our European system and the financial well-being of citizens of European countries and globally.
Madam President, I do not share the views of my colleagues who blame the Commission for their non-delivery.
I think the biggest mistake the European Commission could have made would have been to think that more regulation is always the right answer.
All proposals from the Commission should be proportionate, balanced and well-targeted.
I have been moderately content with how this Commission has responded until now, and I remain confident that the Commission has all the right tools to improve the regulatory framework for financial services.
Improvements should be based, in the first place, on existing legislation and legal bases.
In the second place, soft-law measures should be considered, and finally, if there is no improvement otherwise, then we should turn to legal, new regulations.
I think that sometimes there is a tendency to forget how much we have already done in Europe.
Since 2000 we have gone through a serious overhaul of our financial services laws, and we have updated many of the relevant regulations already.
We have a modern and sophisticated legal framework in Europe.
I think it is followed by most of the people in America already, so I do not think we need to radically change our approach.
Finally, I would like to say that it of course needs to be considered that the supervisory framework is not as good as it could be.
We should develop – based on the ECOFIN road map – the way the supervisors work in Europe, but also we should remember the global scale of things.
We should remember that the financial industry is probably the most global industry in today ’ s world, and we cannot act in a vacuum.
We should remember that we are living together with the outside world, and we should try to develop standards, mutual recognition and convergence with transatlantic players – because that is the way to currently open competition – and also very good rules on the protection of retail clients and the way these things go forward.
Finally, one thing about the ECB.
I think we need to thank the ECB.
The ECB did a very good job.
The consequences to the European economy, both in the financial economy and also the real economy, would have been much more severe without the very good delivery of the ECB in terms of liquidity.
I think the ECB should be congratulated for that.
Mr President, the whole climate change programme has given the EU yet another excuse to flex its muscles and show the world how important it is, claiming that this is an issue that nation states cannot deal with alone.
The 20 20 20 slogan is a typical example of a catchy phrase to work with: 20% of energy in the EU from renewable sources; a 20% reduction in carbon emissions – all by the year 2020.
But you are missing the most important point: is any of this necessary?
We were told recently by the IPCC that 2 500 scientists were all in agreement that CO was responsible for global warming and that we humans were the culprits.
Al Gore ’ s infamous film confirmed that view.
Since then, however, over 30 500 scientists and climatologists have signed the Oregon Petition and the Manhattan Declaration which directly challenges the IPCC conclusions with some very compelling evidence.
So whilst we are urged to believe the IPCC ’ s 2 500 scientists, we are being told to completely ignore the 30 500 scientists who are painting a different picture.
The EU is persuading nations across the world to spend billions of taxpayers ’ money, at the very time when the world is facing dire financial problems, on something that might not only be totally unnecessary, but could well prove to be counter-productive if the latest evidence of global cooling proves to be correct.
We must have a full and open debate to prove exactly who is right.
What do supporters of the IPCC ’ s position have to fear?
You will no doubt be pleased to hear that this will be my very last speech in this Parliament since I retire after this session.
Mr President, it is always a pleasure to speak on matters which will enhance the steady growth of one of the most important international relationships in the globe, that between the European Union and the Republic of India.
We call, in our resolution, for those involved in the summit to explore further ways of upgrading this relationship, and we look forward to concrete results which will be reported back to this Parliament.
It is a critical time for the summit.
We paid tribute in our resolution to the September victims of terrorism in India, including those killed in the assault on the Indian Embassy in Kabul.
But today, surely, we must also pay tribute to those heroes who saved lives in Islamabad, and we must remember that India lies at the heart of a region that is in considerable security difficulties.
It is proper that the wish in our resolution that there should be greater intelligence-sharing should be taken up and honoured, and all efforts to support India in her fight against terrorism with us should be supported – including, we believe, a seat on the United Nations Security Council.
In our resolution we call also for a peaceful future for the former princely State of Jammu and Kashmir, on both sides of the border and now split into two nations.
Peace comes, as we know so well with the European Union, with employment – with jobs – and it is particularly pleasant to learn that India is at present, in Jammu and Kashmir,
building the longest railway tunnel in the globe, which will be nearly 11 km long, as part of a 148-km long section of track.
This will be the longest in the world, 95% complete, which gives 3 900 new jobs of direct employment and, I am sure, many thousands more to come.
And culture: we call, too, for greater links with culture.
This is the year of dialogue, and India has much to teach the European Union on this.
We call for more people-to-people dialogue, and I am sure that is the way forward.
In conclusion, I urge colleagues to support this excellent resolution.
Madam President, as a member of the Committee on Culture, allow me to extend my warm welcome to the initiative of Erna
Hennicot-Schoepges and Katerina Batzeli, members of the Committee on Culture, to address an oral question to the European Commission and have this debate on the progress of the reform of the European schools.
Speaking of multilingualism and its importance, let me use this opportunity to raise a serious concern we have in Romania, where the recent initiative of the Ministry of Regional Development to complete the translation of the EU ’ s
regional operational programme from Romanian into Hungarian met serious attacks from the Romanian Social Democratic Party run by several leaders of the former communist regime.
Please note that this is happening in one of the 27 EU Member States in the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue, at a time when
Commissioner Leonard Orban issued a policy document entitled, ‘ Multilingualism: an asset for Europe and a shared commitment ’.
In the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue, a debate on the reform of the European Schools could not be of greater importance, as we live in a multicultural and multilingual Europe, where different cultures and languages coexist.
We need to encourage and enable such cultural interaction for successful European integration.
Therefore, our European educational system needs to reflect this multicultural characteristic and allow a healthy and easy coexistence.
European schools in particular were set up to meet these needs – to provide multicultural and multilingual education while also strengthening European identity.
However, in an enlarged EU with greater citizen mobility and more agencies being created in different Member States, it has become a challenge to meet these needs.
As the questions in today ’ s debate underline, there is a great need to focus on reforms, as it has proved to be more and more complex to provide multilingual and flexible education of high quality.
Allow me to stress the fact that only by allowing students to express and practice their own cultural identity and
use their own mother tongue throughout their education and formation can we allow them to evolve as true European citizens.
If students studying in European Schools are not able first to develop their national identity through the use of their mother tongue and culture, I believe that they will not have a strong basis to build their European identity.
Thank you for your attention and I wish you good luck in the reform process of the European Schools.
Mr President, I think all of us will welcome the fact that some kind of normalisation is beginning to return to financial markets.
However, this is not a one-strand crisis, unfortunately, and there are other areas that need to be looked at.
One of those is the whole area of credit cards.
Current credit behaviour has proven to be unsustainable, both on an individual and on a broader level.
TV programmes, newspapers and magazines over the last years have highlighted the perils of multiple credit card ownership by people who have trouble paying off even one of these cards.
Obviously it is up to the individual to act responsibly in this regard, but it is also up to financial institutions, and increasingly retailers, to act responsibly in offering advertising and granting these cards.
It is up to us as public representatives to ensure our citizens are adequately informed.
We can stabilise our markets, try to inject liquidity into markets, but if we do not address the issue of responsible credit activity, not just at national and international level, but at all the levels of the economic system, eventual recovery is likely to be limited and unsustainable.
To put this into context, the securitised market for credit cards is about as large as the sub-prime mortgage market.
Madam President, the report refers to the future of cohesion policy.
It was difficult to find pragmatic answers valid for all 27 Member States and their different governance and partnership systems.
The rapporteur has managed to come up with very concrete proposals.
On governance, I would like to underline two elements.
We need to empower regional and local authorities with a better and more efficient sharing of responsibilities.
It is also of the utmost importance to address the lack of expertise and administrative capacity to deal with funds and projects at regional and local level.
On partnership, the report rightly insists on the centrality of inclusive processes and full ownership.
We need to bring in the largest number of stakeholders possible at all policy and implementation stages, and in order to do this we need minimum compulsory standards.
I am extremely satisfied with the way in which the rapporteur has dealt with all our contributions and concerns and congratulate him once again for his excellent work.
Madam President, on a point of order.
We have yet again a further example of the ludicrous mismanagement of the affairs of this Chamber.
It is about time that the presidency realised that when votes are to be held they should be held at the time promulgated, and no one is more important than the exercise of our democratic rights during votes.
I ask you, please, to raise, at the presidency, how our affairs are managed, so that that they can be improved and we vote at the right time and speeches are kept to the right length.
Mr President, concerning Amendment 9, which my group voted against, it was crucial for the PPE-DE Group that the democratic process should be completed without any
short cuts that create a democratic deficit, especially now that, in the case of emission trading, the parliamentary process cannot be described in a flattering manner.
We have seen misleading tricks, manipulation and, finally, the rapporteur ignoring the political will of her own group.
This has become even more relevant given the deadlock in the Council last week.
The PPE-DE Group has offered a solution to the problem of damaging industry whilst advancing the climate change mitigation.
Therefore, not only EU industry but also the trade unions are supporting our benchmarking proposal to replace the costly auctioning system.
We are all united in the attempt to reduce harmful emissions.
There is no doubt about that.
The question is how to do it.
Our first concern must be our planet, but I contend that the measures needed to stop climate change will not be helped by the economic decline of the leading climate-friendly economies leading to unemployment in the EU.
Mr President, I should like to summarise the reasons why I voted against the resolution.
First, strengthening the state ’ s role is the wrong answer in looking for a way out from the financial turmoil.
Second, higher regulation and the creation of a new pan-European supervisory authority without clarification of competences are not a remedy to the crisis.
Third, having been rejected by the people of Ireland, the Lisbon Treaty cannot enter into force.
That is why the European Council should respect the outcome of the Irish referendum.
Fourth, the European Council is not willing to go back on its own unrealistic and extremely expensive targets concerning climate change.
This will ultimately harm the living standards of ordinary people.
Mr President, I see that millions of euros of public money are still being allocated to social engineering and to buy popular support for the EU itself in candidate countries, Member States and elsewhere.
We still have roads and bridges that lead nowhere, we are replacing the pavements in Karínia outside the Turkish casinos no less, and EUR 400 million provide electricity in Kosovo, where the subsequent receipts simply disappear.
These are highly questionable political uses of public money.
No wonder the taxpayers in net-contributor countries like mine are increasingly objecting to EU funds being given to countries whose tax burden is lower – sometimes much lower – and which effectively replace the lack of local tax revenues.
Given the nature of these irregularities, I wrote to the Court of Auditors recently to clarify the legality of payments from public funds which are being qualified under international financial accounting standards.
Mr President, as has been discussed, my oral amendment is as follows (paragraph 23): ‘ Proposes that the Ombudsman take measures to reduce the number of complaints in such cases where no action is possible; ’.
The end of the paragraph has been changed.
Madam President, I am extremely satisfied with the work of the Ombudsman as explained in his annual report and in his speech.
The European Ombudsman is a vital part of the democratic structure and functioning of the Union.
The largest proportion of the Ombudsman ’ s inquiries concern lack of transparency and refusal to provide information.
This is an area of our activities that we must improve if we are to become more credible in the eyes of citizens.
It is important that we support the work of the Ombudsman and that of the Committee on Petitions.
Both deal with the handling of complaints and petitions on EU matters from citizens that help us to find out what is not working at European level and to take corrective measures.
Cases being brought to the Ombudsman and to the Committee on Petitions are of increasing complexity and therefore require greater investment of resources by the institutions in order that citizens ’ concerns are properly addressed.
If these concerns are properly addressed, then we will be making some progress towards improving the credibility of, and confidence in, the Union as a whole.
Madam President, I think lots of things have been said about the financial crisis but it is very important to have one viewpoint.
We are too self-critical at the moment in this Parliament and also too self-critical vis-à-vis the EU institutions.
Let us not forget that we have had a very radical overhaul of our financial services legislation during the last eight years.
We have proper laws.
We have proper regulations and the supervisory system has also been improved.
Of course we could not avoid the crisis, but we were not the birthplace of this crisis: it was born in America.
It was born in the United States because of their lack of regulation, their lack of supervision and their lack of proper implementation.
We should avoid over-reacting in Europe.
This is not the proper time to give in, having good impact assessments and a better regulation agenda, as Mr Bushill-Matthews just said.
This is the perfect time to have well-targeted, well-prepared proposals and take them through.
If we react incorrectly it might have serious consequences.
It might even bring a more serious crisis upon us.
For example, if we accept legislation which makes it more difficult for financial markets to recover, it is not to the benefit of European citizens.
We should now take it coolly and we should try to avoid improper, ill-targeted and ill-prepared legislation and not be too self-critical.
The Commission should be thanked for bringing through this very important change in European legislation and supervisory regime.
Madam President, I find what the Commissioner has said rather disappointing.
I know that he is standing in for Mr Dimas and could not help but read out what was given to him, but I think we need rather more than that.
Environmental legislation is something that most people – perhaps all people – in this Chamber are in favour of – perhaps even including UKIP, who are apparently not here and are perhaps ironing their Union Jacks.
The trouble is that we do not know what is happening in the Member States, and the proposals from the European Commission go only a very little way to improving that situation.
We, in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, are still in favour of having a directive rather than a recommendation.
I do not, myself, see why we could not have a general directive regarding environmental inspections and specific rules attached to specific directives where that is appropriate.
Let me then turn to the question of an EU environmental inspection force.
It is perhaps a little strange that this idea comes forward from the mouth of a British Conservative – vote Blue, go Green – but we do need this, because, otherwise, the Commission is entirely dependent on the Member States for the information that they choose to give it.
It is extraordinary that nine years after the Landfill Directive came into force, Spain is now being prosecuted before the European Court of Justice for having 60 000 illegal landfills, taking up more than half-a-million tonnes of illegally dumped waste.
We think we know what is happening south of Naples.
The Birds Directive adopted in 1979 is still being widely neglected.
The Commission often finds that its prosecutions before the Court of Justice on environmental matters are initiated by private citizens.
I do not think that this is good enough.
We should tell the people of Europe that we cannot be sure that the environmental legislation which we are adopting is being complied with.
Given the fact that we are now looking at climate change legislation, that is very serious.
We must return to the issue of an EU environmental inspection force, which I fully support.
Madam President, the modern world economy is based on a gigantic pyramid of debts: the debts of states, banks, corporations and companies.
The debts are interrelated with one another.
The structural defects of the economic system we have been experiencing and the market economy system that is distorted are basically combined with a money credit system.
The defective functioning of the economy results from linking the system of creating money with credit.
Maurice Allais compared it to a cancer which relentlessly eats away the capitalist economy.
This system provides for the creation of the purchasing power with no real equivalent.
Serious reforms of the banking and financial systems need therefore to be implemented.
The tax system needs to be reformed and the way that stock exchanges work needs to be changed as well.
As regards the plan to patch up gaps in the financial crunch by means of money injections – they are apparently going on in my country too – I think one may put it where the moon does not shine.
Mr President, there is a saying that compromises will never win beauty contests.
At first sight, this could be said with regard to the outcome of all the negotiations on the recasting of the European Works Council Directive.
Based on the Menrad report, adopted in this House six years ago, on the jurisprudence and on the experiences of management and labour in the last 12 years, the PSE Group has always asked for an ambitious revision of the Directive.
Too many workers ’ representatives are still deprived of the basic information and consultation rights as their employer refuses to grant them these rights.
In our view, however, these rights are an integral part of the modelling of all industrial relations.
The position of the worker as the stable stakeholder who stays in the company – compared to the job-hopping of management and the uncommitted attitude of the new type of financial investor – has to be reflected in the corporate governance of our companies.
With the advice of the social partners incorporated in the directive and the additional modifications reached during our negotiations, the PSE hopes to deliver some building blocks for a new dynamic.
The formal political procedure is almost finalised.
It is now up to management and labour to act.
Compliance with the directive, currently some 40%, is still much too low.
The PSE is of the opinion that this is not the end of the story; it is a new beginning.
The European social partners have the enormous challenge of convincing those companies that still refuse to comply with the directive.
We urge the European Commission to contribute to this task.
A new campaign is needed.
Recent research has demonstrated that companies with adequate information, consultation and participation of workers function better, especially in hard times.
The economic crisis and the restructurings that we have to face in the near future make workers ’ involvement in the decision-making process of our companies more topical than ever.
I would like to thank my opponent, Mr Bushill-Matthews, for the professional chairing of the negotiations, my colleagues from the other groups for their political assistance and the French presidency for their sophisticated approach.
Let us go to work.
Madam President, thanks and congratulations to Mrs Doyle, but I think that tomorrow will be a sad day for democracy in the European Parliament.
We are invited to endorse a deal agreed with the Council behind closed doors.
We have knowingly thrown overboard our chance to dig away at the Council position through the full codecision process.
I see no point in Parliament pressing for more, new powers, if we are not prepared to exercise those we have.
Because we have been hurried along in accordance with a false timetable we have omitted our responsibility to ensure that there is a complete assessment of the impact of the climate change package by impartial authorities.
For example, I was the rapporteur recently on the Waste Framework Directive.
It promotes the idea of energy-efficient combined heat and power stations, but such plants may be penalised under the revised ETS.
Was there any discussion on this important point?
What happened to it?
Broadly speaking we have accepted what has been said by those states who are most alarmed by the package.
We have omitted to put in place a robust impact assessment apparatus for the EU and now we pay the price.
Nor do we have the slightest idea whether the targets set in the package are really going to be met.
Are we convinced that there will be strong enough oversight of implementation, despite what Mr Dimas has said, and rapid action against states that do not put into operation even this weakened package?
How will we control all those effort-sharing projects in developing countries?
If climate change is so important, we need a much more active approach to implementation than has been the case on environmental policies anywhere so far, and we have heard nothing about that.
If anything good comes out of this, it must be a new resolve to secure watertight guarantees on implementation and a standardised system of impartial impact assessment such as they have in the US Congress.
Someone said that this rushed first-reading agreement was not to be seen as a precedent for Parliament ’ s willingness to give in to the Council and throw away its powers, the powers it has under codecision.
But it will Mr Borloo, will it not?
And future Parliaments will live to regret it.
Mr President, many of our colleagues want to vote in favour of the idea in the Green resolution not to make internet providers and telecom providers responsible for the content on the internet and so on, but many of those colleagues who want to vote in favour of the Green resolution do not like paragraph 15, which is related to another subject.
In a spirit of Christmas compromise, we would like, in an oral amendment, to withdraw paragraph 15 from our resolution, in order to enable more people to vote for it.
Mr President, e-justice – electronic justice – can we say that such a thing is possible in an activity that is conditioned by human weaknesses and virtues, which are very human characteristics?
No! Can there be borderless justice?
As you said, no, again! Because this is a human activity, which is also very different in every part of the world.
Do those two ‘ nos ’ mean that we must turn our back on technological innovation?
Again, of course, no! We must try to exploit human innovation.
A portal for information: yes! Exchange of data: yes! Awareness of the interindependence of the judicial systems: yes! Contribution to the creation of a European demos: yes!
But for common faceless justice – and I do not say that you are doing that in your report – no! My father, who was a judge, would not be too eager for me to defend electronic justice before the European Parliament.
If I myself speak from the European Parliament to my father, who is in heaven, I can tell him that I know that justice will always be a man, his defender and a judge – not before God but before their conscience.
Mr President, nowadays we are faced with a paradox.
Although a majority of European consumers have repeatedly stated that they are against GMOs, surveys show that they do buy GM foods when they are available in supermarkets.
Many consumers are just not aware that GM food is sold in Europe or simply fall into the trap of illegible labels and end up not knowing what they buy.
A possible solution would be to allow the absence of GMO in foods to be mentioned on the label.
But currently there are no common provisions on GM-free labelling, leaving the Member States the freedom of choice.
This leads to confusion of consumers and distortion of the internal market since, while some countries have already introduced non-GM labelling provisions, others refuse to allow this kind of information to be given.
People want to make food choices based on their own values and not according to safety assessment studies.
If we care about consumers ’ concerns, then we should be transparent all the way and give them a real choice.
Therefore I call on the Commission to provide the legal framework for voluntary GM-free labelling at European level.
Madam President, I have been deluged with messages from growers from all over the south-east of England who regard this proposal as near catastrophic.
It will result, they tell me, in smaller crops and in higher prices, and it will open the way for importers who do not have the same criteria imposed upon them.
There will be job losses, some units will become non-viable and production will stop.
There will be closures in my constituency because there are, in some cases, no alternatives to key substances used by specialist growers.
There has been hopelessly inadequate impact assessment in many countries except my own, and the switch from risk assessment to hazards has already been commented on.
If you are going to use hazards as criteria you might as well ban petrol and caffeine.
Even the science is against you; pest resistance problems will be aggravated; there will be a loss of biodiversity.
Integrated pest programmes have already decreased the need for pesticides.
What is important are the options, not quantity.
And you seem to have ignored the benefits of crop rotation.
You have no right to destroy one of the few sectors of British agriculture still thriving just to appease Danish disinclination to process drinking water from the ground.
Madam President, let me join those Members who consider the second-reading agreement a well-balanced compromise, given the complexity of the matter.
It shows the way for further improvements in the sector, towards more efficient and safer plant protection products, and is flexible enough to
avoid situations in which the ban on certain pesticides would, in the final analysis, reduce the irreproachability of agricultural products.
In particular, I wish to welcome the improvement of the original Commission proposal aimed at avoiding the duplication of tests and studies and promoting non-animal tests.
I hope that this could have an impact on other, related sectors, such as plant protection product data requirements, which are right now moving through their own revision process.
Even if pesticides, in contrast to chemicals, are intended to be toxic and their safety assessment is therefore a special case, it does not mean that redundant animal testing should take
place or that scientific knowledge cannot develop in ways that will identify further redundancies and that further potential reduction in animal testing will be possible in future.
It should be noted that development and registration of new agricultural pesticides or plant protection products can use upwards of 12 000 animals in dozens of separate and often overlapping tests.
Madam President, I voted against this simply because the proposal has been hijacked in effect by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and Commissioners.
The rapporteurs yesterday boasted about standardisation, and yet this is allegedly a Union of diversity.
If there were one area where judgement, discretion and diversity are needed, it is perhaps this.
This was essentially an agricultural issue, but the Danish Commissioner for agriculture was nowhere to be seen at any time, and that is a disgrace.
The reason, of course, is because of a conflict of interests since the Danes fail to process their drinking water after it comes out of the ground.
Farmers in my part of the world feel totally let down and frankly insulted by the fact that there are some assumptions here that they do not know what they are doing, and they need to be told.
Essentially you have added yet another group to those in the UK who frankly loathe the European Union ’ s interference.
Mr President, firstly, I would like to thank Mr Coelho for his excellent work.
Although we all have different political opinions, he did his best in order to achieve a compromise.
The Verts / ALE Group strongly opposes the extensive introduction of biometrics until its necessity is proven beyond a reasonable doubt.
We believe that it has crucial implications for personal data safety and for fundamental rights.
We voted against biometrics in visas.
We are also against biometrics in European passports.
We see the current proposal as a possible way of establishing limits for fingerprinting people for a travel document.
Therefore, we are satisfied that the compromise with the Commission and the Council is achieved, the age limit of 12 years is established for those Member States where fingerprinting of children does not take place and the age limit of six years is established for other Member States.
I would like to stress once again that our support for age limits does not mean that we support fingerprinting as such.
We strongly believe that biometrics in passports can be used only for verifying the authenticity of the document or the identity of the holder.
Use of such data for other purposes, such as law enforcement, is neither legitimate nor proportional.
We cannot agree that everyone holding the European passport is a usual suspect whose fingerprints are to be stored.
That is our position, but I would like to stress once more than we congratulate Mr Coelho and the Commission and Council on this compromise.
If I could welcome the answer given so far by the Commissioner but also ask him to make sure that human rights in this field are kept in mind at all times.
In other words, I am all in favour of stamping out cyber crime, but can we make sure that internet companies are not, with police authorities and the like, too heavy-handed in dealing with the public who are using the internet for their own pleasure?
I know that the Commission has put forward proposals on credit rating agencies and other initiatives that address instability in financial markets to try and ensure that a similar crisis does not reoccur such as CRD, deposit guarantee schemes and Member State balance of payments.
Could I ask him, what proposals does the Commission plan to put forward to encourage growth and competitiveness in the real economy, especially in the SME sector which is particularly important now as more and more European economies are experiencing recession?
Mr President, returning from the Gaza Strip after seeing the massacre – predominantly of civilians – I feel the urge to express my wholehearted solidarity with the Palestinian people.
For 17 days, they have been facing the enormous Israeli war machine that is flagrantly violating international law.
I also express support for the peace forces in Israel calling for an end to this war.
After a long closure and siege that converted Gaza into the largest open prison in the world, the building of the shameful wall around the West Bank,
the continuous expansion of the settlements, and the effective division of the Palestinian land, the occupying forces have moved to the fiercest military operation.
In this, the rocket attacks against southern Israel – and I stress that I am against any attack from whichever side on civilians – served as the pretext.
The ending of the ceasefire against the background of the power games in view of the Israeli elections is an insult to a whole nation.
The UN Security Council has adopted a resolution.
Israel is a state, not an organisation; it is a member of the United Nations.
It has a responsibility towards the international community, and has to comply with this and all other resolutions adopted by the United Nations.
There should be respect for international law.
No impunity should be permitted any longer.
There should be a full international investigation.
The international community demands an immediate ceasefire, the immediate withdrawal of the military forces, access to humanitarian aid, and freedom of movement for the population.
Let UNWRA carry out its mission.
The EU has taken steps, but only at a humanitarian level.
It has to show decisiveness at the political level.
Use the clauses in the association agreements.
Stop the upgrading of relations with Israel.
Stop arms exports to Israel.
There can only be a political solution to this conflict.
There should be a full return to international law, which means ending the 42-year-long occupation of Palestine, and establishing a sovereign and viable Palestinian state, thus building a peaceful future for both Palestinian and Israeli children.
To save future generations, we need to stop the war now.
Mr President, I agree with the position that Mr Speroni has put forward.
I recognise the difficulty you are in, but I would suggest that he is right.
The screens do record every vote.
To read out every amendment result would be very time-consuming – especially with a vote like we have today.
I would suggest that you ask the Bureau to remit it to the relevant committee, and we will consider it for a future voting session – if that is acceptable to the House.
Mr President, I should like to thank the rapporteur for her work.
Let me make a few points on the Strategic Energy Review and the last energy crisis problem, which are closely linked.
My first point: in our report, which calls on the Member States to speak with a single European voice on energy issues, we have
explicitly stated what all Europeans have seen in the past weeks to be the reality, namely that damaging energy supply in the Member States afflicts the European Union as a whole.
It is very important.
This is the basis of European solidarity and a basis for developing emergency response measures.
My second point is that the report mentions CCS technology as having the potential to meet our environmental targets while exploiting a source of energy – coal – that is largely available in Europe.
By developing CCS, Europe can become a world leader in advanced technologies, which will contribute to our global competitiveness and strengthen our economies.
The same is true for coal gasification technology, which is very important as an additional source of gas supply – it means diversification of gas supply.
My third point is that this strategic document specifically underlines the need for investment in the energy supply infrastructure.
Infrastructure projects that receive support at EU level should first and foremost contribute to the real diversification of sources and routes of supplies to the Member States and to the EU as a whole.
Investment in Ukraine seems to be of special importance for us.
Together with our Ukrainian partners, we could, in the future, take the joint responsibility for gas deliveries on the Russian-Ukrainian border.
The reason for such a step on our part is very simple.
In terms of energy relations, Ukraine identifies with international standards.
It has ratified the Energy Charter Treaty and, therefore, plays by transparent rules.
My fourth point is that our strategic document greatly complements our efforts towards implementing the Third Energy Package.
What does it mean?
It means a working internal market in energy for the European Union; it means solidarity and support on many sides.
Let us finish the legislative procedure during the next three months.
It is very important for us.
Madam President, I should like to thank Mr Lagendijk, whose great political skills have produced a wonderful resolution for us to work from.
I thank him particularly for accepting paragraph 26, to which I wish to draw the Minister ’ s and the Commission ’ s attention.
Here we note the exceptional ill-health of 1 500 Roma people, who are sitting on the edge of a lead mine and have been there through UN misjudgement for nine years.
I fully accept that, as Minister Vondra has said, this is perhaps not quite the mission of the European Union.
Nonetheless, I thank the Commission team for picking up this topic immediately I raised it and for visiting and for seeing the damage that the lead levels have caused.
These people have monstrous lead levels in their blood, irreversible damage, and need immediate and urgent relocation and medical treatment.
Minister Vondra, you promised that you would keep this Parliament fully briefed.
May I ask you, as President-in-Office, to give this matter your profoundest attention and to tell me what you do.
Mr President, the citizens of Europe need a strong Union with a competitive foreign, security and defence policy.
This will not happen if our Union keeps idle in one place.
China and India are growing, not only in economic power, but also in military might.
Europe ’ s competitive advantage should be based on knowledge and innovation.
This should be nurtured and supported by all of us.
In an effective security strategy, our European forces should have access to equipment and resources of the highest quality.
While the United States spends trillions of dollars on security, we in Europe are slow or idle in developing our own strategy.
In a time of crisis, we are closing firearms factories, like the factory in Radom, Poland.
We should instead be investing in advanced technologies, such as the recoilless technologies being developed in Poland as we speak.
Innovation creates new business and jobs.
We cannot build European capabilities by shutting down our own factories.
− Mr President, I have to say at the outset that I very much welcome the communication which has been prepared by the Commission.
I think it is both comprehensive and ambitious.
In my report, Commissioner, I recommend which practical actions, investments and processes are needed if we are to identify that very special place for children in external action.
The Commission and the Council communication and conclusions on external action will build upon the external dimension of the EU strategy on the rights of the child.
I believe that this is essential work for the European Union.
Commissioner, I now look forward very much to seeing actions intended to match the ambition which I see.
We need to see substance backing up the rhetoric.
That means that resources must be available and, of course – as I am sure you will agree – there must be no backtracking by the European Union Member States on the commitments they have made to fund the Millennium Development Goals (MDG).
What we know is that, for most of the world ’ s two billion children, it is a daily struggle against poverty and vulnerability.
As we know, 98% of the children in our world living in extreme poverty are living in developing countries.
Furthermore, it is now clear that the impact of the financial crisis will be severely felt by children and young people, for instance when the budgets are cut back on health and education.
That is why I think it is right that we make a political commitment, at the highest level, on behalf of and with children.
The EU must see in its partnership with the developing countries the opportunity to influence public policy to save children ’ s lives.
Priority actions for children must be promoted when the European Commission negotiates the country strategy papers ’ regional and thematic strategies, when they are drawn up, and subsequently when they are reviewed.
When there is budget support, including MDG budget contracts, specific objectives and indicators on children must and should be included.
I welcome the Commission ’ s intention to draw up partner national action plans for children.
We need assurances that even the most marginalised children – including children with disabilities and orphans – have access to equitable health, welfare and judicial services.
I believe there needs to be more and better training of Commission staff – both in Brussels and in delegations – particularly in how they manage the participation of children.
We need to see a radical rethink in the European Union about how we ensure that we listen to children and invite children to participate, because we understand that it is
children themselves who give lives to the values that are enshrined in international law through the Convention on the Rights of the Child agreed in 1989.
It is my experience that the children themselves – the young people – have a wealth of understanding and experience – which we must tap into – on how to tackle poverty and environmental degradation.
I welcome the fact that the Commission recognises the importance of consultation during the preparation of the EU strategy on the rights of the child.
I also understand that this has been planned for the first half of 2009.
Commissioner, would the Commission be able to confirm when this process will begin?
I trust there will not be any decision that the public consultation – including with children – will be put on hold until a new Commission and Parliament is in place.
Finally, to quote Kofi Annan, ‘ There is no trust more sacred than the one the world holds with children.
There is no duty more important than ensuring that their rights are respected, that their welfare is protected, that their lives are free from fear and want and that they grow up in peace.
’ I think all of us would agree that those are fine objectives.
Mr President, the European Commission produces its annual competition report and it is traditional for the European Parliament to cast its eye over the report and to produce an own-initiative reaction to it.
In this case, because of timing factors, the reports for 2006 and 2007 have been brought together but – taking up one of the points mentioned by Commissioner Barrot a little
earlier – it is the case that the context of our consideration of these reports has changed rather markedly, since we in fact began the exercise of considering the report some time ago.
At that time, we were focused on the whole business of the modernisation of competition policy, the significant amount of work taken forward by former Commissioner, Mario Monti, and by the
current Commissioner, Neelie Kroes, and on looking at the impact of that in terms of the Commission ’ s ability to deal with the abuse of market power and to deal more effectively with mergers and state aid.
By and large, that has been a very good story in these reports and this is very clear from the reaction that we have from Parliament ’ s own report.
We have seen record activity on the part of the Commission in terms of dealing with hardcore cartels, we have seen the development of the leniency system, we have seen record fines put into operation by the Commission and we have seen record activity in terms of mergers and state aid notifications as well.
This is a process that is gathering pace in terms of modernisation because the Commission is currently bringing forward proposals, in a White Paper, on introducing private damages. That is something, similarly, that our committee and Parliament have been supportive of.
Our committee has drawn attention to two specific concerns – what we regard as being the unequal relationship between producers and retailers, particularly in relation to food retailing.
Parliament has, in fact, put down a written declaration on this, signed by more than half of the Members.
Our committee has also expressed some concern about abusive practices in the services sector.
However, I mention the change of context because, of course, we all recognise that since the reports were published by the Commission, the Commission ’ s work – in terms of state aid particularly – has really taken on a rather different dimension.
Almost on a daily basis, the Commission is now looking at the effect of the bail-outs that are taking place in the context of the current financial turmoil.
It is very important – and our report says so – that, in addressing those matters, we recognise some of the challenges that there are for an effective, open market.
It is very important that, when the Commission gives its approval, it is giving that approval in ways which are compatible with the Treaty and do not create such significant market power in future that it becomes a scenario for abuse in its own right.
The banking sector in the United Kingdom at the moment is one very clear area where there will have to be, when economic circumstances become a little calmer, a
general review of the new architecture that we have got and of whether that architecture really is compatible with the operation of a free, fair and open market.
We have received reassurances from Commissioner Kroes in this regard but, nonetheless, our committee has put those pointers down in this report.
Generally our view is that the Commission is to be congratulated in its work and that is the thrust of the report, which I anticipate will be passed tomorrow by a very large majority.
Mr President, in the case of online gambling, there must be clear and unambiguous laws that serve to limit, control and account for the nearly EUR 3 billion in annual gross revenue realised by the gambling industry.
However, according to Mrs Schaldemose, that EUR 3 billion is only 5% of the total gambling market in the European Union.
Therefore, the importance and influence of this industry is obvious – as are its dangers.
Gambling is often correctly associated with crime at international level, and cross-border gambling rings which are much easier to run via the Internet jeopardise the laws of various nations and harbour risks to national sovereignty.
It is also important to note the negative effects on health associated with gambling.
As a medical doctor, I am well aware of the damaging characteristics of obsessive or addictive gambling.
These are not issues that the European Parliament can underestimate.
When it comes to tackling fraud, criminal behaviour and financial and medical issues that correspond to online gambling, I call on the European Parliament to vote repeatedly on better and better solutions in future.
Mr President, at the heart of this directive is the problem of control and of costing.
How can we ensure that laws adopted by the EU as a whole are applied, and how can we legislate without knowing the cost of what we want?
The rapporteur wants to bring in a universal system of uniform emission limits, which would have to be worked out in a huge bureaucratic exercise that would take at least eight years.
No one knows how much it would cost – it is called the European safety net.
I tabled Amendment 134 on staying outside the high-emission industries with standards based on best available techniques, leaving the implementation of such measures to the discretion of the Member States.
That is realistic and affordable and observes the principle of subsidiarity.
If the European safety net is adopted, I hope the Council and the Commission put pressure on Parliament to have an impact assessment done on the idea.
The question is whether we have the will to make a uniform European Union-wide system – a European safety net – work.
The answer is that all the evidence so far shows that Member States lack that will.
They will not support a European environment inspectorate: they want to stick with national enforcement agencies.
The right answer to our quandary is not to invent a huge new bureaucracy that will never spring into life, but to use our money to bring up the standards of morale of national enforcement agencies to do their job in helping to put EU law into practice.
I commend to you Amendment 129, which exempts standby generators in healthcare facilities from pollution controls that would treat them as though they were operating 100% of their time.
That amendment will save money at a critical time for health budgets.
I commend to you the amendments on large combustion plants: unless we get these into the directive, my country will face power blackouts.
People have enough to blame the EU for without that! My final point concerns compromises and Mr Turmes ’ s attack on me: the first reading is not a time for compromises, but rather a time when we fire off all our amendments and ideas and discuss them.
We cannot have compromises that prevent discussion.
Finally, I commend to the future Parliament the current Rule 55, which would allow us to have a renewed first reading of this very important directive.
It seems wrong to have the first reading in the old Parliament and the second reading, without a first reading, in the new one.
Madam President, these three very extremely important reports have been drafted by Socialist rapporteurs.
This, of course, is not by chance.
The thrust of these reports, the amendments that will be presented by the Socialist Members to improve them, and also I think today ’ s debate, show very clearly that there are distinctive policies: distinctive right-wing and Socialist policies towards the crisis.
The right-wing policy is pretty simple: the crisis is a bad thing but we need to be patient, it will pass; we need to take some technical measures and things will calm down by themselves and we must express our sympathy to the people who will be hit.
The Socialist position is much more complex.
We say that we must attack the roots of the problem, the roots of the crisis, that we must radically change the economic paradigm, that we must change and that we must curb all the speculation that has led us to this financial crisis.
This has not been a neutral crisis but a crisis inflicted by specific policies, mostly by right-wing governments.
Madam President, I would like to congratulate Commissioner Rehn on his position on the Oomen-Ruijten report, which was that it is essential for Turkey to proactively support the ongoing talks between the leaders of the two communities in Cyprus.
That is why we are in full agreement with the rapporteur when, in paragraph 40 of her report, she calls on Turkey ‘ to facilitate a suitable climate for negotiations by withdrawing Turkish forces and allowing the two leaders to negotiate freely their country ’ s future ’.
I would suggest that, at this moment of direct talks, it might not be advisable for the European Parliament to include in its report any proposal for derogations from the acquis.
To complement the rapporteur ’ s position, we also call on Turkey to comply with its obligations regarding investigations into the fate of missing persons and to stop interfering in the Republic of Cyprus ’ exclusive economic zone.
In so doing, Turkey will itself facilitate its way towards accession.
Madam President, first of all I would like to congratulate the rapporteurs who are involved in this very important report.
I think the economic crisis has forced us to take a long, hard look at our past economic behaviour.
That, in turn, offers us an opportunity to learn from our past mistakes.
I suppose that, when our economies were powering ahead, we unfortunately left certain groupings behind.
Addressing and improving access to microcredit offers us the opportunity to address these past mistakes.
Reshaping the microcredit framework can help us reinforce and rebuild our economies from the community upwards.
In Ireland some commendable work has been done in this regard.
In my own constituency of Dublin there are four enterprise boards that have been set up since 1993 and they have been supplying local-level support to microenterprises all over Dublin City and County.
The Association of County and City Boards in Ireland announced its own financial stimulus package earlier this year, aimed at supporting 3 000 enterprises around Ireland and creating 15 000 new jobs.
The project also includes training for nearly 50 000 people.
On a European level these are small figures, but our microcredit enterprise in Dublin and Ireland is hugely significant.
I sincerely hope that, following on from this excellent report, we see significant and coordinated action at Community level to support the invaluable work that is being done
by and for microenterprise at local and national level around the European Union, as it is a very important part of our economy today and a very important part of our economy into the future.
Mr President, the Committee on Regional Development and the funds put into the whole of Europe are the most important programme in the whole of the European Community.
I can speak for North-West England and say how very much these funds have benefited the city of Liverpool, in particular, over the last 10 years.
Looking onward to the future, I can see that city continuing to expand on the basis of these well-allocated, well-controlled funds.
I would call for more involvement of the private sector in the way that the funds are allocated, managed and controlled, because the private sector can always do a more efficient job than the public sector.
I would also like to emphasise how very invaluable these monies have been to the rural areas of the North West, where there are a lot of agricultural areas, which are vital to the whole economy.
Finally, let me say that I back Mr Becsey on his microcredit.
This is a very interesting development and essential at this time in the economic situation.
Madam President, last year we voted with a persuasive majority in favour of the resolution proposing to ban the cloning of animals for food and the sale of any products from cloned animals and their offspring.
Ahead of voting on the legislation on novel foods we should recall the reasons for having been prudent and aware of risks for the health and welfare of animals.
We know, from our past experience with similar issues that tackle both food safety and ethical relations between humans, as the dominant species, and nature, that public perception depends very much on specific knowledge of the matter.
Consumers are increasingly sensitive about suffering and injuries to farm animals and therefore they have the right to be informed about the potential of cloning to cause pain and to waste natural resources.
Yet the development of animal cloning as a method of food production is being pursued without public awareness.
The problems with cloning do not concern just the welfare of animals, but also consumer confidence in food since it is believed that in Europe food is produced to a very high standard.
The Eurobarometer study from last October documented serious public concerns with regard to hypothetical future use of food products from clones.
This is linked to the sale of imported food, which could eventually be sold in Europe without being labelled as a product from cloned animals.
I therefore agree with the rapporteur ’ s approach urging the Commission to come up with a separate piece of legislation on clones.
Among other problems which have been covered by the amendments tabled by my political group, I wish particularly to
support the sharing of information from animal testing so as to avoid the need for new tests involving animals.
Finally, many thanks to the rapporteur for her thorough work on this important piece of European legislation tackling food safety, as well as consumer protection, and animal health and welfare.
Mr President, over the years Europe and the rest of the world have fought to battle discrimination on all levels.
Our progression as decent humans demands that we do just that, respecting perfectly the subsidiarity principle.
As Mrs Buitenweg has stated, the Commission has promised, for over four years now, to pass a broad and inclusive proposal on the human rights of all people.
This is now coming, finally, to fruition.
I strongly believe that no person should ever be discriminated against on the basis of his or her religion or belief, disability or age.
On the contrary, as a Christian believer I call upon the European Parliament and each individual to not only stop discrimination but to help those who are being discriminated against because of their disability.
This help can come from us in different shapes and forms.
Each Member State has constantly persisted in improving equal access to those who need it the most.
As Europe continues to integrate, it is paramount that we remember that we are all different yet perfectly equal in all regards.
Mr President, we are grateful to Mr Lax for his best efforts to achieve a compromise in such an ambitious project.
The Greens / EFA Group still believes that the amendment suggested by Parliament would be the best solution.
For example, there could be – and there will be – practical problems while dealing with the main destination, instead of our proposal to provide free choice when applying for visas.
The Council has agreed to the obligation of the Member States to cooperate only.
Unfortunately, the visa fee will be EUR 60 instead of the EUR 35 suggested by Parliament.
Hopefully there are a number of waivers and reductions for children, students and active youth.
Although it was not possible to achieve a compromise on issuance of multiple-entry visas by default, at least we have now an obligation to issue such visas in certain cases.
The right to appeal against a negative decision is also a big step forward.
Now, in many Member States, such a right does not exist.
As a human rights activist in my previous life I especially thank Mr Lax for this provision.
Of course, for my group, incorporation in the report on visas of the report on biometrics looked like a fly in the ointment.
We are against such a wide introduction of biometrics.
Still, we see some improvements in the visa policy, and therefore we will support this report.
Mr President, European legislation was set to encourage enterprises to improve their products and obtain higher standards of energy efficiency and environmental compliance.
Ecolabelling as a part of the EU action plan on sustainable production, consumption and industrial policy is such a tool.
And so is EMAS, the eco-management and audit scheme.
It is about striking a balance between regulatory and market-based instruments, with the aim of developing voluntary standards for various products and services or helping to optimise production processes and make more effective use of resources.
Now, the problem is how modern technologies can be used for environmental protection, and how industry or services should be helped in promoting the environmental value of the production.
The goal of ecological certificates is to engage synergies with other legal acts that are tackling environmental aspects of the products.
EMAS is saving resources: among them, water.
From past experience we know that certificates at various levels were not sufficiently coordinated.
Existing voluntary and regulatory instruments were not linked to each other in order to establish synergies.
First revision of the EMAS scheme was not encouraging.
It was initially expected that EMAS-registered companies would have performed better, since the EMAS
environmental requirements are tougher as compared with older and better-known certificates such as ISO 14001.
Yet EMAS-registered companies were not performing better, and the system of environmental excellence was weaker as compared with the ISO 14001.
The Commission found reasons for the lack of success – the system is too tough, too expensive and too complex – and has proposed acceptable simplifications.
The rapporteur, Mrs McAvan, added valuable additional modifications.
Among them is a line in the definition of EMAS which I saw as particularly important.
It would help organisations to proceed more easily from ISO to EMAS standards.
I am confident that our amendments have made the Commission proposal for the regulation better and that we have brought it closer to users.
An impartial system of certification will be, we suppose, appreciated also by consumers.
I hope that this will help organisations to choose the most rational systemic approach in order to interconnect different fields of environmental protection.
− Madam President, I would like to start by sincerely thanking the rapporteurs, the shadow rapporteurs, Commissioner Piebalgs and Ambassador Reinišová for the excellent cooperation during the first three months of this year.
That cooperation has been the main engine of the successful outcome we will be voting on this week.
Negotiations have been long, complex and sometimes tough, but I think we have managed to get an agreement that is satisfactory to all parties.
Regarding the overall package, as it has been negotiated, Parliament can be proud of the final text.
Indeed, our very strong first-reading agreement on ownership unbundling gave the negotiating team a lot of leverage during the talks.
This has allowed us to obtain a much tighter regulatory framework, in particular in countries with the ITO model in place, where the competencies of national regulators will be increased, with independence from both governments and industry.
This new role will reduce the risk of uncompetitive behaviour, especially in circumstances where vertically integrated companies abuse their position to stop investments in new capacity.
Furthermore, agreement has been reached on the review clause that will allow us to check, in a few years, whether all models satisfy our goals of achieving a fully competitive and legalised market.
Moreover, we have substantially increased the provisions on consumer protection with regard to, among other things, billing information and improved conditions for switching suppliers.
Finally, another big success has been the introduction of a new provision in the third-country clause, whereby the certification of a transmission system operator (TSO) from a third
country could now also be denied if the security of supply of the Union as a whole, or that of an individual Member State, other than the one where the certification is requested, is threatened.
Concerning the electricity regulation, I would like to make clear that this regulation plays a crucial role, since it gives Member States the tools needed to significantly increase interconnection capacity within the Union
by the development and establishment of binding network codes to be applied by all transmission system operators to exchanges, thus removing one of the main physical barriers to the completion of the internal electricity market.
The agreed text also enhances the role of the Agency for the Cooperation of European Regulators in this process, in line with the first reading in the European Parliament.
I must admit that Parliament hoped for a much more ambitious agency.
However, we understand that this is only the first step in a long process of integration of regulatory frameworks.
We have managed to include a new provision whereby the Agency will be able to propose the basic criteria to be included in the granting of exemptions for new interconnections.
This is particularly relevant since it is one of the main obstacles investors in new capacity face when dealing with different Member States.
Having to follow several different regulatory procedures can sometimes lead to confusing results and put off investors – take, for example, Nabucco.
This regulation also establishes, and gives a defined role to, the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO), which will be in charge of drafting the network codes
to be submitted to the Agency, as well as developing coordinated mechanisms for emergency situations such as the European Union-wide blackouts we have suffered in the recent past.
I would like to finish by thanking all the technical staff, whose work has enabled us to obtain an agreement which, at the very beginning of the negotiations, we at times lost faith in reaching.
Mr President, by the time allocated to this debate, one might say that Parliament attaches little importance to saving forests.
This stops the disappointment of discovering the shy Commission approach to addressing illegal logging, but what disappointed me the most was the repetition of the argument that we should not punish the good-faith EU operators in order to solve an external problem.
Part of solving a problem is also creating awareness about the problem, and it is high time we acknowledged that some European regions – like mine – are also confronted with rampant deforestation.
The illegal logging regulation does not aim to punish or to hinder trade but rather to better control trade.
It is true that the Commission proposals were not really clear on how the system should work in practice.
I am pleased that the EP managed to strengthen and clarify the proposal by covering all timber products and requiring all operators to exercise some sort of due diligence by introducing a new baseline for financial penalties and providing clear criteria for a credible and independent monitoring system.
Now our challenge is to have this system adopted and implemented sooner rather than later.
We need to give consumers the guarantee that they are not fuelling the environmental degradation by accidentally buying illegally harvested timber products.
Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mr Skinner on this report.
He has done an excellent job.
It has been a huge undertaking but he has really delivered on this very complex piece of legislation.
I would also like to congratulate the European institutions and Member States, who have brought us this successful conclusion of Solvency II.
It is a good example of how Europe must work together towards financial recovery.
Burdens will be shared, as will solutions.
This European approved response is a good example of a closer relationship on financial cooperation.
We have to work to make sure that there is never again a banking crisis like the one we are going through at the moment.
I did notice with great interest the Commission ’ s approval of a mortgage support scheme for UK homeowners.
This scheme will allow householders who are unable to meet their mortgage repayments to defer all their principal and up to 70% of their interest payments for a period of two years.
We should carefully follow the progress of this scheme and learn from and implement any effective measures that would ease the burden we carry.
I think this is something that all Member States can look at, but I also think that financial institutions in Member States themselves could make it easier for people to move to interest-only mortgages if they found themselves in difficulty.
The financial institutions, considering the support that they have from Member State governments, could do a lot to help people who are under stress because of the recession.
Mr President, the decision that we are about to take is a very important one.
The Socialist Group is in favour of postponement for four reasons of principle.
The first is the credibility and the role of our own Parliament.
It is very important to say, from the outset, what Parliament can and cannot do.
What it can and must do is control democratically the accounts of the Council, too, notwithstanding the gentlemen ’ s agreement that has been put in place.
The second reason is interinstitutional equilibrium.
It is important that we do not do something that we cannot do as a Parliament, but it is also very important to say that it is our right to have a view, to
have an opinion on the Council ’ s accounts, when these accounts are operational and where these operational accounts must be accounted for.
This is the democratic principle and this is what we are about to do.
So we are not saying we want to do something else.
We are saying we want to do our duty.
The third reason is the respect and the preparation for the Lisbon Treaty.
You know very well, colleagues, that, with the Lisbon Treaty, the common external policy acquires much more depth and much more momentum.
It is a much more important common policy and we cannot from the outset say that Parliament will not have a bearing on that policy at all.
We must have the opportunity now to say what the role of Parliament is.
The last – and probably the most important – point is transparency vis-à-vis the citizens.
Our role as a Parliament is accountability vis-à-vis the citizens.
We cannot, and we must not, say to the citizens that the big common policies, like the external and defence policy, will lie outside the democratic control of our Parliament.
So for those four important reasons of principle, we believe that we must vote in favour of postponement.
Mr President, very briefly, I am trying to be helpful, but am getting hungry.
These are important votes and it is a very full agenda and I have every sympathy with you.
I have just been down to the press room and I note that eight journalists are actually listening to the vote – others may be watching on the screens, where every single vote is being broadcast.
I therefore think that to read out the result of every vote is not necessary.
Madam President, the Legal Affairs Committee supports the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on cross-border payments in the Community.
The aims of the Commission initiative are as follows: firstly, to replace the existing regulation in order to adapt it to market developments; secondly, to advance the protection of consumer rights
and to provide an adequate legal framework for the development of a modern and efficient payment system within the EU; and thirdly, to achieve an internal market for payment services in euro.
The Legal Affairs Committee was appointed to submit an opinion to the lead Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
In the opinion it was proposed that Member States may appoint existing institutions to act as competent authorities and to utilise or extend existing procedures concerning cross-border payment services.
It is important to apply and improve already existing measures and redress bodies to deal effectively with complaints and disputes regarding this proposal.
It is important to point out that the principles of proportionality, subsidiarity and especially the extended principle of equality of charges for cross-border payments should comply with the EC Treaty, Article 95 (1).
Cross-border payments in euro require a Community-wide approach because the applicable rules and principles have to be the same in all Member States in order to achieve legal certainty and a level playing field for all European payments market stakeholders.
Mr President, this morning we will be voting on a joint motion for a resolution co-signed by four political groups on the situation of the Ashraf refugee camp in Iraq.
Three thousand five hundred Iranian men and women, members of the democratic opposition to the fundamentalist regime in Iran, live there completely defenceless.
In the last few weeks they have been under pressure and harassment by the faction of the Iraqi Government under the influence of the Iranian regime, and there is a high probability that at any moment a tragedy could happen that would parallel the ones we witnessed in the Balkans not so long ago.
We all remember Srebrenica, and I have no doubt that no Member in this Chamber wants a second Srebrenica in Iraq.
Our motion for a resolution is a call to alert public opinion all over the world before a disaster takes place.
Unfortunately, some colleagues have tabled amendments that could increase the danger for the residents in Camp Ashraf and provide the Iranian regime and its proxies in Iraq with arguments to massacre them.
I recently visited the camp myself and I assure you that the allegations included in the amendments tabled are absolutely unfounded.
People in Ashraf are there on a volunteer basis.
They are free to leave whenever they want and they live in the best friendly relations with the Iraqi population of the region.
The intention of our motion is to protect these people.
Nobody would understand – but if these amendments are adopted the result of the motion would be exactly the opposite.
This is not a political issue, colleagues: it is purely humanitarian and it is very urgent.
I beg you to vote against all amendments tabled to this joint motion supported by these four groups and support the motion as it has been agreed by these four groups that are of very different political stances.
The lives of many innocent and harmless people depend on your vote.
Please do not let them down.
Mr President, I believe that Alejo Vidal-Quadras, a good friend of mine, and others who have spoken are profoundly mistaken and that we should support the amendments, because the Iraqi Government
has announced on more than one occasion recently that it has no intention whatsoever of forcing the inhabitants of Camp Ashraf to leave for Iran or to go to any other country.
The Iraqi Government has repeatedly requested different countries, including many EU Member States, to receive them, and we have not agreed.
Of the 3 400 people living in the camp, 1 015 hold residence permits from, and enjoy resident status in, different countries, many of which are EU Member States, and we are not accepting these people.
Why?
Most of the camp ’ s inhabitants received professional military training during the previous Saddam Hussein regime and they participated with his presidential
guards and with other security forces in the violent crushing of the Iraqi people ’ s popular uprising after the liberation of Kuwait in 1991.
There is ample evidence that these people harmed the Iraqi people when the Iraqi army refused to carry out the killings that Saddam Hussein required.
The families of the victims in Iraq cannot forget this fact, and the Iraqi Constitution does not permit the presence of groups such as the NKO or the PKK on Iraqi soil.
Two thousand of these people have registered themselves with the High Commissioner for Refugees, hoping to be transferred to other countries ready to accept them, and for several years now the Iraqi Government has been working closely with UNHCR asking other countries to accept them.
Dear colleagues, this is the business of Iraq.
The sovereignty of Iraq is at stake, and we should place our trust in this democratically elected Government of Iraq.
This is their right, their duty, and I can assure you they are fulfilling it correctly.
Mr President, today is 4 May and this will be my last speech here.
However, 30 years ago today Mrs Margaret Thatcher was elected as British Prime Minister and she faced similar Socialist-caused problems to those that we face today: crippling debts, rising unemployment and public unrest.
She understood the solution was small government, individual freedoms and national self-determination.
Today the EU imposes big government, increasing central control and the erosion of the nation state.
I can also remember her saying ‘ no ’, ‘ no ’, ‘ no ’, words the EU ignores or does not understand.
She went on to make that now famous speech in Bruges that sparked opposition to the project.
The EU is a 50-year-old attempted answer to a 200 – year – old problem.
I maintain if the EU was the answer, it must have been a very silly question.
And, as they say in Star Wars, may the fourth be with you.
Madam President, as shadow rapporteur for the Liberal Group, I would like to thank Malcolm Harbour and my other colleagues for their excellent cooperation.
This dossier is of great importance for all electronic communications users in the European Union, and the compromise we agreed in the end with the Council – and they were not at all easy discussions – was a balanced one.
There have been some important achievements as a result of the negotiations with the Council.
One of the great improvements in comparison to the first reading relates to access to the 112 European emergency number, and the obligation of operators to make caller location available without any derogation on the grounds of technical feasibility, at least for fixed and mobile telephone operators.
This is a major achievement since it will help the emergency services respond more efficiently, and will enhance the protection of all citizens ’ lives wherever they are in the European Union.
The provisions on traffic management policies were a controversial point in the report, but I strongly believe that the compromise protects users ’ rights to access content and use services of their own choice.
No one in this House ever wanted to restrict freedom on the Internet.
Our objective has been to allow traffic management procedures, as long as they are necessary, to ensure the best possible online experience for end-users, and as long as they do not restrict competition between service providers.
I consider the compromise to be totally in line with this objective, which is why I fully support it.
I also believe that all measures regarding access to, and use of, services should respect the fundamental rights and freedoms of all citizens, and this has also been safeguarded in the report.
Some among us may not be happy with this compromise, but I would like to stress that, despite its shortcomings, this is the best we could achieve with the Council, and I strongly advise you to vote for it tomorrow.
Mr President, there is a saying that if you are not at the table, you are on the menu.
The next decade will decide where Europe is going to be.
The current leading generation in Western Europe had a holiday from history.
We grew up in peace.
We grew up in a welfare state.
We made debts and passed them on to our children.
But history is knocking on our door.
We will have a sluggish economy for years to come; we are facing mounting immigration and are sustaining an ageing population.
Unfortunately, Europe does not have a culture of achievement.
The European dream is to retire to the French Riviera as soon as possible.
If we do not innovate and develop an entrepreneurial culture as you designed, Europe will be on the menu.
I count on your leadership.
May I give you one piece of advice: keep Europe focused on its core task.
If you fail there, you will fail everywhere.
Remain open-minded and do not propose a European tax because it will provoke a pitchfork revolution against Europe.
I have never seen a demonstration in favour of a European tax.
It is simply a bridge too far and you will only feed public anger.
I count on your sense of realism to get Europe at the table and not on it, and I wish you good luck in your second term.
Madam President, the Lithuanian Law on the Protection of Minors from the Detrimental Effects of Public Information struck human rights defenders and media people in Lithuania and beyond as overly homophobic and profoundly undemocratic.
Please let me draw your attention to the fact that this law was vetoed by the former President of Lithuania, Valdas Adamkus, but he was overruled by the Lithuanian Parliament.
In addition, this law has been severely criticised by the current President of Lithuania, Dalia Grybauskaitė.
The law was assessed in vigorous terms by the Lithuanian media, commentators, and civil liberties and human rights defenders, who stressed its homophobic substance along with its extremely dangerous political implications, such as censorship and self-censorship.
This law has little, if anything, to do with the protection of children.
Instead, it is against gay and lesbian citizens of the country.
Whatever the case, the equation of homosexuality with physical violence and necrophilia is morally repugnant and deeply disgraceful.
Still, it is difficult to believe that the adoption of such a law is possible in an EU country at the beginning of the 21st century.
Personally I take this law as an unfortunate move and as a profound misunderstanding, to say the very least.
Changes to Article 310 of the penal code and Article 214 of the administrative code are being debated in Lithuania ’ s Parliament that will criminalise, with the threat of a fine, community work or imprisonment, anyone involved in the promotion of homosexuality in any public space.
If this is not our slide to state-sponsored homophobia and criminalisation of public expression of our gay and lesbian citizens, what is it then?
Last but not least, this law is a disgrace, but even more so would be an attempt to obfuscate, trivialise and, in effect, justify it.
This is to say that I strongly support the resolution.
Mr President, I welcome the idea of a strategy for the Black Sea region as a pilot project for the macro-regional strategies.
Initiatives of this kind allow the coordination of EU policy instruments in order to have a coherent, stable and sustainable development of the regions involved.
On the occasion of the last Council, it was said that a strategy would have been developed for the Black Sea region by the end of 2009.
This is an extremely important initiative as it can bring about harmonised development and prosperity for the region that, in comparison with the Black Sea area, is far more complex in terms of actors involved and relevant for security, stability, energy and the environment.
So I would like to ask the Swedish Presidency when such a strategy for the Black Sea region will be delivered, and when Parliament will be informed and involved in this issue.
Mr President, first of all, please let me express my sincere sorrow for the huge tragedy that hit Taiwan on 8
August and in particular for all the people that were killed by the incredible energy of the devastation from this major disaster.
Morakot was the deadliest typhoon to hit Taiwan in nearly 50 years, ravaging the island in early August and leaving about 700 people dead or missing, forcing the evacuation of thousands and burying hundreds of village homes in mudslides.
On this occasion China showed great sensitivity by sending immediate aid to help Taiwanese victims.
Not only was the Chinese Government ready to assist the island, but also private companies and organisations of different kinds including the Association for Relations across the Taiwan Straits and the mainland Red Cross Society.
Also, the Chinese population afforded help with fundraising events organised to relieve the island from the disaster.
According to the last figures, the Chinese mainland has so far donated to the typhoon victims about a CNY 1 billion, which is the equivalent of nearly USD 150 million.
An important role in this situation was played by the several hundreds of prefabricated houses that were sent from China to Taiwan in order to put a roof over those who had lost their dwellings.
I would like to underline the fact that the European Union, attached to the One China policy, welcomes the help that China offered Taiwan on this tragic
occasion because this shows an improvement in the relations between the two territories, and it is clear that an improvement in such relations can lead to greater stability in this region.
I also think, and with this I conclude, that, given the dimension of the disaster, the European Union should make use of one of its
core values – solidarity – and offer Taiwan additional material and financial assistance in order to help with the massive task of reconstruction.
Mr President, in my opinion, freedom of the press in a country can only be properly assessed by considering every aspect of the question.
This should include a thorough analysis of the markets, including the advertising markets, and of the habits of the population, like the average time spent watching TV, distribution of the printed press and levels of literacy, etc. We would notice certain spectacular differences in those factors in Italy compared to many other Member States.
As long as these outstanding differences, for example, concentration of media ownership and party political power over the public media, are not openly discussed, the Italian pattern will insidiously convince many people.
I would like to compare it to a virus – not dangerous enough to kill the bearer, but definitely weakening him and with the potential to infect others.
Members of the European Parliament present should know that in Estonia, one centre-left party has recklessly followed the current Italian model by concentrating all public and private resources under the party ’ s command and spreading unilateral messages all over the capital city of Tallinn.
I would have nothing against a European discussion on that issue here as well.
That is why, unlike the PPE Group, I believe it is time to discuss the freedom of the press and to adopt a resolution.
The resulting resolution should not be considered some kind of settling of scores between political parties in one or other Member State but rather should be viewed as an opportunity to promote the values on which our Union is based.
That is an interesting question.
It takes historical research: have the centre-left governments done anything about it?
In my speech, I pointed out that the centre-left party is doing the same as Mr Berlusconi is doing in Italy, so the debate is about Europe, about freedom of speech and about threats to freedom of speech from either side – left or right.
That is my opinion.
Madam President, compared to the 2009 budget, the Commission proposal for 2010 provides for a moderate increase in the budget lines concerning internal market and customs policy, whereas the amount of money allocated to consumer policy remains stable.
In the draft 2010 budget, the Council has decreased the money, in particular, for budget lines which concern the development of the internal market.
I believe that a functioning internal market in these times of economic crisis can contribute to the economic recovery.
In the area of customs policy, the budget will assure cooperation and coordination measures, thus reinforcing security and protection of external borders, supporting the fight against illicit trafficking and fraud as well as improving the efficiency of customs systems.
I consider measures in the area of consumer education a priority, in particular, the strengthening of financial literacy.
The crisis has shown how important consumer policy, in particular, consumer education, is, in order to help consumers take responsible economic decisions.
For all these reasons, the IMCO Committee called for a separate budget line on the SOLVIT programme to be financed by an amount of EUR 1 million.
SOLVIT is a very good example of how you can help businesses and citizens.
Finally, for the continuation of the pilot project monitoring measures in the field of consumer policy for the consolidation of a scoreboard and related market study, as a preparatory action, the amount adopted is EUR 1 million.
Mr President, it is extremely important to fight the economic crisis, and that also means helping the small and medium-sized enterprises.
We must be committed to the outcome of the Stoiber Committee, and I want to hear from both the Commission and the Council whether they are committed to this process and what we are going to do, because we have to cut red tape.
Another point I would like to discuss is the Ankara Protocol.
The Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs said in a public interview in The Hague that Turkey will not ratify or implement the Ankara Protocol.
That is a statement in an authorised interview in of 7 October 2009.
What are we going to do?
We cannot, as Commissioner Rehn said in the Foreign Affairs Committee, just kindly ask again.
The deadline is 1 November.
What action are we going to take?
Thank you very much Mr President, Commissioner, Minister, I have to start with the footnotes.
As much as I really admire the rhetorical flair of our friends from UKIP, I find it quite interesting as someone coming from Central Europe that you are so ready to share your experience of living under the Titoist regime in Yugoslavia or under the Soviet regime.
Really interesting.
First of all, let me congratulate Elmar Brok for preparing a report which so magnificently represents the mainstream, and let me repeat that, the mainstream of this House.
With the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty and the new Service, we will increase our ability to speak with one voice.
We agree that the new Service should be as close to the Commission as possible, because only the Community method guarantees the coherence of our actions and, most importantly, the points of view of us all will be taken into account to the same degree.
For the new service to be credible it has to be endowed with as much democratic legitimacy as possible.
Therefore, all the efforts to take care of this House ’ s powers of scrutiny have to be saluted.
Most importantly we have to do everything to ensure that the new service is of the best quality and that it is trusted by everyone.
We have to do our utmost so that the Commission, the Council and 27 Member States send their best people to work in the EEAS.
That is why they have to enjoy the same status.
Work in the Service should be treated as an integral part of their career at home.
The people working for the service have to be chosen on merit, but also according to geographic balance so as to counteract the unfounded fears that the Service could be hijacked by anyone.
The Lisbon Treaty is important and different from all the other treaties because so much depends on its implementation.
I hope that the insights of this House will help the Council and the Commission to actually implement this Treaty in such a way that we will increase our ability to speak with one voice.
Madam President, I have asked for the floor today to inform you of a rather disturbing fact that has come to my knowledge whilst on a visit to Washington DC as part of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs delegation.
On the margins of the current transatlantic negotiations on data protection (SWIFT, PNR), the United States is expanding its National Security
Agency data-collection facilities so as to intercept every electronic message within its territory as well as all messages coming in and out of the country.
How can the US pretend to respect the right to privacy when it is building an enormous eavesdropping agency – and how can we just sit to one side and let that happen?
It is our responsibility to raise awareness of this gross abuse of power and violation of our basic rights.
I hope you will join me in informing our voters and the citizens in our countries about this through declarations and articles to the press.
Mr President, as announced yesterday in the debate, a political joint declaration of the European Parliament and the Council has been
agreed as a commitment of the two institutions endorsed by the Commission to proceed to the completion of the process for Bosnia and Albania as soon as possible.
I would now like to read the text of the declaration. ‘ The European Union strongly supports the goal of the abolition of the visa regime for all the countries of the Western Balkans.
The European Parliament and the Council recognise that the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia fulfil all conditions for visa liberalisation.
This has allowed for the adoption of the amendments to Regulation (EC) No 539 / 2001 in due time to allow these three countries to join the visa-free regime by 19 December 2009.
The European Parliament and the Council express the hope that Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina will also qualify for visa liberalisation soon.
To that end, the European Parliament and the Council urge those two countries to make all efforts to comply with all the benchmarks set in the Commission ’ s road map.
The European Parliament and the Council invite the Commission to present a legislative proposal for amending Regulation (EC) No 539 / 2001 as
soon as it has assessed that each country meets the benchmarks of the road maps with a view to achieving visa liberalisation for citizens of these countries as soon as possible.
The European Parliament and the Council will examine a proposal for amending the Regulation concerning Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina as a matter of urgency.
’
Mr President, two Azerbaijani youth activists and bloggers, Emin Abdullayev and Adnan Hajizade, have been sentenced to two and a half years and two years respectively, in an unfair trial.
The charges against them were fabricated and they have been imprisoned solely for exercising their right to freedom of expression and association.
The Azerbaijani authorities must release the prisoners of conscience, Adnan Hajizade and Emin Abdullayev, immediately and unconditionally.
The Council, the Commission and the Member States of the European Union must raise the issue of democracy and human rights with the Azerbaijani Government.
It must be reminded that democratisation is one of the goals of the Eastern Partnership, and Azerbaijan is part of that initiative.
Azerbaijan has to live up to its obligations as a member of the Council of Europe and partner of the European Union.
Well, I did not hear a real question, but of course we agree that there are multiple reasons to say ‘ no ’ to Turkey.
I just mentioned a few, but this is another good reason to say ‘ no ’, so thank you for that.
Mr President, we, as Liberals, are against the death penalty in general, but here the death penalty in China is used to oppress minorities, like the Tibetans, the Uighurs and others.
Furthermore, China is not a democracy.
Human rights are not respected.
China has a harsh policy against Taiwan.
China should be put under pressure.
This is difficult, I know.
It is an enormous market, but we should fight for our principles.
Therefore, we support this resolution.
Mr President, as a member of the delegation that went to Palestine last week, it became clear to me that there are a number of sensible people who believe that the two-state option is dead in the water,
largely because of Israeli actions, not least the proposals to extend the wall even further into and beyond East Jerusalem, thereby dividing the West Bank into the north and the south.
What interests and what actions are we likely to take if the single-state option becomes a reality?
Secondly, are the Presidency and Lady Ashton aware of how much the views of, again, sensible people about the charade that passes off as the Quartet is prevalent amongst a number of people?
What actions are we going to take to ensure that the cost of this operation is matched by its effectiveness, which presently is nil?
Mr President, I support the environmental goals for 2020, but I have some serious doubts about some methods.
The Copenhagen conference was a good example of a bad method.
And what were the lessons?
The conference was too massive to be productive: a rock concert of 50 000 people is possible; a meeting, not.
Secondly, Europe was outfoxed by China and India, and the US joined in.
Instead of being a decisive player, the EU was a confused spectator.
What should we do?
I think we have to reassess the form we used, rather a G20 than an event of Woodstock proportions.
Secondly, we have to stop displaying moral arrogance by telling China and India what to do.
Important barriers to punish both countries would be disastrous.
On the contrary, the EU should re-examine its own stance, which will ultimately undermine our own growth and employment.
Finally, we need serious research on the body of evidence.
‘ Climategate ’ was already a reminder, and the claim that the Himalayan glaciers are retreating now seems to be based on speculation.
Some members of the IPCC now even predict global cooling.
We need objective, impartial scientific research, and not an agenda-driven political activism.
What is true and what is not: at present, we simply do not know, and I think we need to have the facts right, first.
Commissioner, Minister, I hope you will look at these questions with an open mind.
Mr President, the information about violence against Christians in Egypt and Malaysia is just the tip of the iceberg.
There are three points I want to raise.
First, Christians have become the victims of brutal violence in many countries of the world, not just two.
Second, Christians have become the single most persecuted religious group in the world.
The numbers are astounding – in the millions, not thousands or hundreds of thousands.
Third, the reaction of European societies, European governments and the EU has, so far, been unsatisfactory: timid, faint-hearted, pusillanimous, politically correct, or no reaction at all.
We must act resolutely, or else those who persecute Christians will think they have our tacit blessing.
Do we really want this?
Mr President, all elements of this agreement are important but I want to focus on the bluefin tuna issue.
It is vital that we act now to prevent a stock collapse and to allow the numbers of bluefin tuna to recover.
In 2006, the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tuna agreed on an action plan designed to improve reporting and monitoring of stocks and inspection of vessels.
But it is clear that it is not enough.
The stocks, particularly the eastern stock in the Mediterranean, remains critically low and there is a very real risk that we will soon witness the extinction of this endangered species.
The Conference of the Parties to CITES should therefore agree to place bluefin tuna in Appendix I of the Convention, and the Member States and the Commission must do more to combat illegal fishing and to enforce agreed restrictions and quotas.
Mr President, I welcome the opportunity to support this resolution.
The Copenhagen Summit was a disappointment in many respects.
The EU failed especially in demonstrating a unified and efficient approach to climate change treatment, as well as in strengthening its leading political position in this agenda.
I consider, therefore, taking this resolution, an act of utmost importance, in order to demonstrate the unbroken spirit and determination of the EU as the leading force in the world in combating climate change.
We have to enhance and promote further activities aimed at climate change treatment.
Madam President, I wish I could be given the time to explain to the Members of this Parliament the reasons why the Greek people are so sensitive about the issue concerning the name of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
Unfortunately, it needs more than a minute.
This story, going back to the late 1940s, is a sad story which ended in creating a false idea about them.
I can assure you that Greeks are neither nationalists nor expansionists.
All they do is resist the use of a name which is part of their own ancient historical and archaeological tradition.
I understand that the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, as a new independent state, is undergoing a retarded ethnogenic phase.
Serious academics in Skopje do not support the nationalistic trends of their Prime Minister.
They prefer to remain silent rather than expose themselves against the trendy phrase, which the Thaler report rightly remarks, is liable to increase tensions.
I would like this Parliament and the new Commission to try and contribute with a solution to the name issue, not by stimulating the nationalistic tendencies of the
FYROM Government, but by supporting the Greek view, which fights for a gentle compromise that would, finally, seem to satisfy the people of FYROM more than the people of Greece.
Madam President, looking at the positions that the European Court of Justice, the Council, the Commission and Parliament have taken so far on gambling and betting, I would draw the following conclusions.
Practically all Member States and Parliament reject the application of the country-of-origin and mutual-recognition principles in this particular and sensitive area.
The Court accepts that, as it explicitly expressed once again in its judgment last September.
For the Commission this judgment means that it loses one of the key arguments that it has used in all infringement cases.
Member States are free to set their own policy objectives on betting and gambling and define in detail the level of protection they deem appropriate for their citizens.
The Council and Parliament have been working hand in hand for years.
In 2006 and 2007 they both agreed on the exclusion of gambling and betting from the Services Directive and the Audiovisual Media Services Directive.
The Schaldemose report last year built on the work Council had done under the French Presidency and the same line has continued also under the Swedish and the Spanish Presidency.
In the Schaldemose report I was responsible for the EPP line and I share her view.
Commissioner, I would like to ask you this: do you share the view that the Commission should finally start helping the Member States in their
fight against all illegal – in other words unauthorised – gambling offers, rather than consume time on questions that have been answered already?
If so, how will it be tackled?
Mr President, there is guilt on both sides, but an overreaction on the part of Israel over this report and indeed over Operation Cast Lead.
Goldstone is a respected judge of considerable repute, and Jewish.
There are undoubtedly flaws in this report, but Israel must recognise that the core of the criticism is based on fact.
You only have to listen to Israeli soldiers who admit to their dubious activities on occasions in the organisation ‘ Breaking the Silence ’.
Israel has been forced to admit the use of white phosphorous as a result of this inquiry, so why has there been no real investigation into the actions of some of their soldiers who have been involved in potential, if not actual, war crimes?
The PLC has admitted its transgressions, but Israel on this issue and on the recent Dubai assassination must cease to be so arrogant and recognise the justified concern of sensible decent people throughout the world.
Mr President, SEPA is a commendable initiative that will undoubtedly be of great benefit in improving the efficiency of cross-border payments and turning the fragmented national markets for euro payments
into a single domestic one, by enabling customers to make cashless euro payments to anyone located anywhere in the area using a single bank account and a single set of payment instruments.
Another major benefit will result from the reduction of the overall costs to the European economy of moving capital around the region, which is estimated today at two to three per cent of the total gross domestic product.
We must remember that the end goal of SEPA was to create a truly domestic payments environment all around Europe, and it is understandable that achieving such an ambitious
goal is by no means easy, especially when considering the unfortunate necessity of finding compromises between the often conflicting interests of the pan-European banking community.
The economic crisis has only hindered the process of implementing SEPA standards; this is a costly process and the banks have understandably had other, more urgent priorities in recent times.
An analysis of the current situation should be carried out and, I think, a realistic timetable set as soon as possible.
It is now essential that a legally binding deadline for migration to the use of SEPA instruments be established, as my colleague, Mr Karas, has just said.
It is unacceptable that to date, there is no concrete schedule in place.
The notion that domestic standards should be allowed to run in parallel with SEPA is inefficient and counterproductive.
I therefore call on you, Commissioner, and the Commission, to bring certainty to this already fragile sector and ensure that a legally binding end date for migration to SEPA instruments is finally set.
Mr President, Roma, the largest European minority, are suffering from institutional discrimination, anti-Gypsyism, extraordinary levels of poverty and social exclusion, segregated systems in housing, education and social welfare.
Short-term solutions are not an answer to the widespread and deep-rooted problems of Roma.
We need to evaluate existing good practices, as well as the negative effects of existing policies for the Roma population.
One, but not the only, example is taking Roma children away from their families and putting them in separate boarding schools.
These measures do not solve problems: they lead, rather, to more segregation, and impact deeply and negatively on the lives of Roma families.
Europe needs an effective long-term Roma strategy.
This summit gives us a new opportunity for affirmative action, different from the first Roma Summit, which did not include real political commitments in the EU.
The EU should start by setting a good example, by offering more positions to Roma people and including Roma and civil society in the strategy.
Mr President, colleagues have introduced an amendment which we could agree with if we combine it with the original amendment.
I understand the colleagues and we share the view that our strategic decision should not depend on Russia, but, on the other hand, Russia is an important partner.
If the colleagues could agree that we take their amendment and say ‘ including Russia ’ – Russia is one of the members of the continental dialogue – we could agree and we could vote for this amendment.
What is the Minister representing the Presidency going to do to protect groups of our fellow citizens who are at risk from poverty and social exclusion as a direct result of
Spanish policy towards British and other Member State residents in various areas of Spain whose properties are being expropriated and who are suffering under dubious planning policies?
The Minister on behalf of the Presidency cannot evade this issue anymore; he must pursue the Spanish Government and invite them to take the necessary action.
Mr President, on a point of order, I think you would find that if you took the first vote at 12.00, people would then sit down and participate, rather than waiting for them to sit down and participate and then taking the vote.
Mr President, usually when this House makes a resolution which has even a slight connection with the situation in the Middle East, it is hard to find mutual understanding.
That is not so in this case, thanks to the colleagues who have made it possible.
The situation of Gilad Shalit is a humanitarian issue and our joint resolution underlines the fact that, since being taken hostage nearly four years ago, he has been kept in an unknown place in Gaza, where he does not enjoy basic rights according to any humanitarian standards, including the third Geneva Convention.
It is from this humanitarian perspective that we demand the immediate release of Gilad Shalit.
Meanwhile, the minimum requirement is that the Red Cross and Shalit ’ s parents may be allowed to be in contact with him.
The value of a human person cannot be measured.
It is immeasurable.
Gilad Shalit should not be made a bargaining chip by the terrorist organisation Hamas but should be released immediately.
This is the message that we would like the High Representative, Baroness Ashton, to take with her to Gaza during her forthcoming visit.
Mr President, 2008 was an extremely important year for the European and indeed the global economy.
It was the year that was characterised by a great deal of uncertainty as regards the extent of the crisis, which only seemed to worsen.
A great deal of uncertainty was also present with regard to the time it would take for the European economies to recover as well as the tools that we should use to stimulate such a recovery.
This was no easy year for the ECB, which had to face a number of challenges.
During 2008, the ECB engaged with other major central banks to form a coordinated approach in order to provide the banking
system with plenty of short-term liquidity, and this approach by the ECB proved to be extremely successful.
In this respect, I must support my colleague in the conclusion he has come to concerning the performance of the ECB.
I agree that 2008 was instrumental and that those responsible have risen to this occasion.
I also share some of the rapporteur ’ s concerns with regard to the lack of transmission of interest rate cuts from the bank to the consumer and I feel that this should be further looked into, so please take note, Mr Trichet.
All in all, I feel that this is an extremely well-balanced report, an excellent piece of work by my Maltese colleague, Edward Scicluna.
Mr President, may I remind this House that one year ago, Communist abuses were met by a popular revolt in the Republic of Moldova.
The protests brought to power a pro-European coalition and, one year on, the new government proved its European stance.
The Moldovan Government needs immediate support from the EU, and there are three ways in which European support can help Moldova: quick financial assistance, abolishing of visas and the conclusion of an association agreement.
I also have to mention here the case of Ernest Vardanian, a journalist arrested, held incommunicado and indicted for high treason by the so-called authorities in Transnistria.
It is a serious human rights violation.
I am asking the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and the EU Head of Delegation to Moldova to act urgently for the immediate release of the detained journalist.
Madam President, the Chair of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, Mr Simpson, is not able to join us today and has asked me to read out his statement.
The recast on the development of the guidelines of the TEN-T network seeks to bring together the various amendments adopted over the years to the guidelines and to incorporate amendments that take account of the enlargement of the EU to 27 Member States.
To give a bit of background to the report, the guidelines give direction to the development of the Trans-European transport network.
The objective is to establish the network gradually by 2020 by integrating land, sea and air transport infrastructure networks throughout the Union.
Turning back to the report at hand, it is, strictly speaking, a codification of the legislative text, but, because the Commission made some minor changes to the annex, they were forced to do it via the recast procedure.
The changes to the annex are to correct initial mistakes that were made during the accession of the 10 new Member States that joined in 2004.
The changes are not about updating the maps or making any substantive changes. The two changes the rapporteur has introduced to the report involve minor modifications in the recitals and some technical corrections to the maps.
These are in line with the changes made by the Council and in line with correcting the guidelines.
Following the Commission ’ s advice, the decision was taken, both by Council and by Mr Simpson as rapporteur with the backing of the Transport Committee, not to make any substantive changes to the guidelines.
The rapporteur is, however, aware that the Greens have retabled their own amendments seeking to update the line between Munich city and Munich airport, but the rapporteur would like to reiterate the point that the changes we are making in this report are about correcting the text, not updating it.
The point of this recast is to bring everything into order ahead of the real revision of the guidelines during early 2011.
It is important to ensure the clarity of the guidelines in preparation for the more substantial changes that will take place next year.
We are all eagerly awaiting the real revision of the guidelines and the chance to further develop the TEN-T network but, in order to get to that stage, we need to get the current legislation right, and that is what we have done here.
Madam President, I would just like to thank the colleagues who have contributed to the debate today and reiterate my point that we are looking at correcting mistakes made in the past and not at making any substantive changes.
That will come later on with the real revision of the guidelines and, of course, we are looking forward to that debate.
For this reason, the rapporteur, Mr Simpson, and myself, as coordinator for my group, will be instructing my own political group to vote against the amendment put forward by the Greens.
We hope that the other political groups will be able to support us on this.
Madam President, I strongly disagree with the previous speaker.
This House had to answer a question on whether or not we should convene a convention to decide that issue, and we have taken a decision not to do so, but we have done so out of respect for this instrument – for this new instrument, which actually increases the legitimacy of all the decisions which we make.
Obviously that does not set a precedent for the future, because all the really important issues concerning the changes to the Treaty, such as for example the electoral procedure, would require the convening of a convention.
Let me thank Íñigo and the coordinators for taking the decision.
It was not easy.
We had a problem with designating an additional 18 Members of this House because certain Member States did not actually plan for a procedure, but we decided that
representativeness is the most important issue, that this is the principle which we should be guided by and that this House should have a balanced representation as quickly as possible.
That is why we took a pragmatic solution, prompting Member States to complete their election procedures as quickly as possible, provided, obviously, that all the parliamentarians who are going to join us are going to be directly elected.
Mr President, some hours ago I would have said that, in spite of the tasteless distortion of cultural emblems and despite articles of ambiguous objectivity referring to outdated stereotypes, although the Council
failed to apprehend the Greek economic crisis as a major European issue and the Commission failed to use it as a crash test for European cohesion, the Greek people were ready to support their new Socialist government in their struggle for economic and social recovery.
Now, in light of the tragic events of the last few hours in Athens, where three people died because of the violence which arose due to the hard economic measures, I
recall Mr Rasmussen ’ s recent words: the downgrading of Greece ’ s sovereign credit to junk status is an indictment of the policy of prevarication.
I think that it is most urgent for the Members of the European Parliament to strengthen their struggle for cohesion.
I hope that what happened to Greece today just a few hours ago will not be contagious, and I hope that this may mark, on the contrary, the beginning of a unanimous effort for the formation of the European identity through solidarity and through partnership.
Madam President, I wish to thank everyone who has been working very hard on the seemingly never-ending story of SIS II: Mr Coelho and those in the field.
The issue of recurring delays and cost overruns is very worrying and, if not this, what else could be more telling about Mr Barroso ’ s management skills in his first Commission?
I believe that we should take these lessons which can be learnt here today and project them into the creation of a new IT agency, which could be situated in Tallinn.
This would be a win-win situation: while the French colleagues could keep the servers in Strasbourg, the new programming work would be done in Tallinn by competent
specialists with low management costs, thus avoiding a monopoly and embracing the idea of EU integration, and also giving a guarantee of data protection.
Finally, I would like to express my confidence in Commissioner Malmström ’ s ability to resolve these complicated issues.
Mr President, I rise on a point of order to enquire whether it is going to become a precedent that we are to find, on our desks in this House, items of information relating to motions to sign.
Regardless of the merits or otherwise of the case, surely it is to be deplored that we get junk put on our places over which we have no control whatsoever.
Can you please stop it?
Madam President, I hope my colleague, Michael Cashman, and our colleagues will regard my remarks as a supplement and as a token of appreciation, rather than a revision.
The MDGs allow us a unique point of entry into the human condition at the beginning of the 21st century.
Therefore, it is critically important to come up with a new and fresh perspective, instead of offering that of the 20th century.
It is a fact of our time that no development is possible without security, and.
This is why we have tried to offer a more balanced approach to the MDGs, paying more attention to such regions as Central Asia, where poverty goes hand in hand with a lack of safety, insecurity, instability, forced child labour and even slavery.
In addition to the autocratic regimes in Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan, ethnic violence recently broke out in Kyrgyzstan.
Dire straits, combined with instability and violence, may lead to a humanitarian catastrophe in the region.
If we need proof that no durable and sustainable development exists without security, we have it here.
In addition to that, we cannot forget about extreme forms of poverty in such European countries as Moldova and Albania.
Let us take, for example, some grave problems relating to health care.
In Ukraine and Moldova 300 out of 10 000 people suffer from tuberculosis.
The aforementioned countries do not fall into the category of least developed countries but they certainly fall into that of developing countries.
If the MDGs do not embrace the least stable and least secure countries, we will never achieve a viable, social and moral order there.
Therefore, the time has come to expand our horizons.
Although sub-Saharan Africa is crucial to us, we cannot confine the MDGs to this sole, familiar context.
We are facing new challenges and we have to react to them.
Last but not least, the MDGs are inseparable from the necessity to empower the least developed, developing and least secure countries so that they can shape their future themselves.
Mr President, I have prepared a short statement for today, which I should like to read.
It is a great honour for me to be nominated Vice-President of the European Parliament with the support of the European People ’ s Party.
It was a similar honour to receive the highest state decoration of Romania, the Order of the Star, in
December 2009, at the commemoration of the 20th anniversary of the fall of Communist dictatorship in Romania.
Twenty years ago in Timişoara, people of diverse ethnic backgrounds and different beliefs, united by understanding and courage and facing and running the same risks together, rose up against the Ceauşescu regime.
In the same way as back then, I continue my efforts today to represent my country ’ s interests in the spirit of the
fight for human, minority and religious rights and for freedom, while remaining committed to European and Christian values.
I am committed to furthering the European integration of former Communist countries and nations in the Eastern and Central European region,
in particular, that of the Hungarian minority community in Romania that I represent as a member of the European People ’ s Party.
It fills me with joy to be a Member of the European Parliament in the period following the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, which marks a new beginning in the history of a United Europe.
Thank you for your attention.
Mr President, it is surely not beyond the wit of intelligent people to understand that we want to vote for, against or abstain, as we do normally.
Can you not arrange it?
If you cannot, then we cannot take this vote.
Mr President, I rise again to suggest through you to the Conference of Presidents that someone needs to get their act together.
We were told originally that there would be votes at 12.00. This has moved by five minutes every five minutes.
People have planes to catch; it is inconvenient; it makes a mockery of Parliament.
Someone get a grip!
Mr President, I am glad that the EU institutions appear so sensitive to the plight of the Roma today.
For that very reason, it is a pity that policy makers on all sides of the political spectrum seem to use the Roma issue as a weapon against their counterparts.
We all agree that freedom of movement is one of the fundamental principles of Community law, and accept that this right is not unconditional.
As the Commission has confirmed, all EU countries have the right to take security measures regarding foreigners residing on their territory.
The core values of the European Union, such as non-discrimination, tolerance and solidarity, must be fully respected, and the expulsion of any EU citizens must be implemented on a case-by-case basis on the grounds of proper judicial decisions, or with the free, complete and informed consent of all the individuals concerned.
To quote the Commission again, ‘ nobody should face expulsion just for being a Roma ’.
Political opinions and legal judgments are separate issues.
We might find these expulsions distasteful or far-fetched, and we must draw attention to the safeguards and principles to be acted upon, but judging the legitimacy of the measures taken by France is the sole responsibility of the Commission.
Large-scale repatriations might be repulsive, but are even more repulsive given the empty human rights lip-service of recent decades when technically, nothing was done to alleviate the terrible poverty of the Roma, except for the chanting of a few cold words about anti-discrimination and tolerance when it became politically handy.
We, the European Roma, reject the political misuse and misinterpretation of our issues.
The Roma must set the discourse about themselves to reveal the problems and to articulate what actions and measures have to be taken.
As proclaimed several times by this Parliament, and more specifically by the European People ’ s Party, the poverty and social exclusion of the Roma is a European issue and requires a strategy of its own; a common European solution is needed for a common European problem.
That strategy must tackle the economic features of the social exclusion of Roma and non-Roma alike, such as structural unemployment, low qualifications, dwelling in seriously disadvantaged micro-regions and barriers to self-employment – all the issues which our people are escaping from when they migrate.
Madam President, firstly, I would like to convey my sympathy to the people of Pakistan over the tragic loss of lives.
I would also like to thank Commissioner Georgieva for her devoted work in making Pakistan an urgent priority on her agenda.
It took the world and the EU some time to comprehend the full scale of the disaster.
Now, as we understand better the needs of the affected people, our response should be urgent and match those needs.
We need to provide more financial and material assistance while ensuring that help will reach everyone, including minorities, according to their needs.
We must also not forget that Pakistan is a frontline country in the international war on extremism and terrorism.
If we fail to assist them, then poverty and despair may strengthen militancy.
A one-off humanitarian assistance effort will not do.
It should be combined with help to rebuild the country ’ s infrastructure – roads, bridges, schools, etc.
We also need to take urgent measures to help Pakistan in reviving its economy and trade.
Enhanced market access for Pakistani exports and new debt arrangements could turn the tide.
EU Member States should seriously reconsider debt trade-off as a way to offer help in this tragedy.
Mr President, the current economic crisis requires resolute action towards the effective completion of the internal market.
If we are not ready to open our markets, including the labour market, to all European citizens, the losses will be higher than the gains.
Recent studies undertaken by the European Commission have proved that opening our labour market will be beneficial and that worries concerning job losses due to labour migration are totally unfounded.
This sort of scaremongering has been proved wrong again and again.
In 2006, British experts estimated that 300 000 Romanians would flood Britain in search of jobs.
They are still looking for them.
Nothing of the kind happened.
The truth is that there is no rational reason to maintain the labour barrier for Romanian and Bulgarian workers.
Past experience shows that workers from eastern Member States fill a gap in the labour market and take jobs that are not wanted or are not fully covered by the local workforce.
Moreover, there is no way Romanians and Bulgarians will arrive in Western Europe to take advantage of its generous welfare system.
Both Romania and Bulgaria have high enrolment rates in secondary and tertiary education.
Both countries have a highly skilled resilient workforce.
If the EU wants to make full use of its resources in these times of crisis, then political trust and economic openness should be properly established between Member States.
To quote President Barroso ’ s speech of two days ago in this House, ‘ we either swim together or sink separately.
’ To paraphrase this, we either work together or get unemployed separately.
Mr President, the directive that we are discussing aims to limit animal tests and improve the conditions of animals used for research.
In Europe, we already have the highest animal welfare standards in the world and this directive will raise those standards even further.
That is very commendable.
Nonetheless, we must bear in mind that human beings and their prosperity mean more than the well-being of animals, and that there is a fundamental difference in dignity between animals and human beings.
I appreciate the balance between stricter rules on animal welfare and the use of animals, while still allowing research under strict conditions.
I support the ‘ three Rs ’ principle: replace animal tests whenever possible with other methods; reduce the number of animals used to a minimum; and refine standards for breeding, accommodation and care.
Animal tests will only be allowed when no alternative method is available.
At the same time, medical research will still be possible.
That will provide a balance between the ethical necessity of the reduction of animal testing and the requirements of modern medical research.
Here, I would like to strongly oppose alternative methods to animal testing that might include tests based on the use of human embryonic stem cells.
I am concerned about those Member States whose domestic laws do not explicitly exclude from compulsory alternative testing those methods which involve the use of human embryos.
When this directive comes into force, Member States might be obliged to ensure that these alternative methods are applied, whether or not they are based on stem cells from embryos.
I will therefore abstain in the final vote, and call on Member States to provide for alternatives other than those involving the destruction of human life.
Mr President, I would like to move the following amendment as a new paragraph 9a.
I will read it: ‘ Considers that the situation of Roma in Europe can in no way affect the forthcoming accession of Romania and Bulgaria to the Schengen Area, nor the rights of their citizens ’.
I hope the House can support that amendment.
Madam President, we are debating tonight what I believe might be the most important act for the EU in the years to come.
It is within the context of reforming the single market that we have the real opportunity to transform Europe into a more social and sustainable Union, so the question is: does this communication manage to point towards a more green and socially just internal market?
I believe we are not quite there yet.
Let me give you two examples; firstly proposal 29. Here I have to ask you, Mr Barnier, where is the guarantee for the right to strike?
Where is the guarantee that fundamental social rights will not be overthrown by the freedoms of the market?
I am aware that there are different positions within the Commission on this question and I would like to ask you very directly: is it true that among others, the Danish, Swedish, German and British Commissioners have fought against your proposal to introduce a social clause?
If this is so, Commissioner, you should know that you have the backing of this House, because achieving such guarantees would be true reconciliation.
A second example of something that needs to be improved is proposal 19, the introduction of a Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base.
We Greens have been asking for this for a long time and should therefore be happy.
But the problem for us arises when we read the text.
It says that the CCCTB should aim at removing fragmentation for business.
Listen.
I believe that the major problem with company taxes in Europe is not fragmentation, but unhealthy ongoing downward competition between Member States.
This has been going on for 15 years now.
No wonder that we have problems financing our welfare at this time.
I believe the aim of a CCCTB should be to put an end to unhealthy competition in Europe.
That is the real problem.
Furthermore, I think we need to go beyond the proposal right now on greening the internal market, for example, by using green procurement.
I believe we can achieve much more there.
So, Mr Barnier, I believe we have work to do.
I am looking forward to that and thank you for inviting us to join in this very broad discussion.
We appreciate that.
Madam President, the re-launching of the single market has to be politically supported, economically viable and socially acceptable to European citizens.
No revival of the single market will be successful unless we convince citizens that the single market truly represents their interests.
In this respect, I am highly appreciative of Commissioner Barnier ’ s strong commitment to take into account citizens ’ concerns and aspirations.
In fact, Commissioner Barnier went the extra mile to reconcile conflicting views and tensions and to incorporate different priorities of the various stakeholders.
However, in its present form, the Single Market Act does not sufficiently address the social dimension which would ensure the right balance of an open economy, stimulating growth and job creation, but safeguarding in the process consumer protection and citizens ’ rights.
We must not lose sight of the holistic vision of the single market, nor should we approach this act in a defeatist manner, and there I agree with Commissioner Barnier that we should counter ‘ single market fatigue ’, especially when that fatigue emanates from within the institutions.
In my opinion, the single market is not getting the political support urgently needed to ensure that it does not become yesterday ’ s business.
More political leadership on the single market from the Presidents of the Commission and Council would go a long way towards achieving a viable single market to serve as a catalyst for economic recovery.
We trust that Commissioner Barnier will acknowledge our concerns during the coming months of serious discussions.
We must not lose this political momentum and this unique opportunity to revitalise the single market.
I repeat that market integration is not an irreversible process and must not be taken for granted; a weak and fragile single market would lead to more disintegration than integration for the European project.
Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur and the other colleagues who have contributed to this dossier.
I would also like to congratulate Commissioner Dalli.
I think we have reached a good outcome, and now the report is much more patient-oriented than the initial proposal.
Nowadays, patients increasingly tend to seek health-related information so that they can be actively involved in the decisions concerning their health.
Patients also tend to seek information online.
This information is not easy to control on the Internet, but sooner or later we have to deal with that problem, which will not disappear if we simply do not do anything because it is too complicated.
I therefore support imposing strict rules for the registration and monitoring of websites, as well as making available a list of registered websites so that patients can be sure of the reliability of their source.
Safeguards are also needed, and the report provides them, namely by limiting the information that can be made available to information that is approved by the competent authorities.
To this end, we in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection have adopted a number of amendments covering advertising, concentrating on changing the wording from ‘ disseminate ’ to ‘ make available ’ in the context of non-promotional information according to the ‘ pull principle ’, whereby patients have access to information if they need it.
Mr President, I shall try to be briefer than the previous speaker.
My group proposes to adopt the budget as agreed by the Council.
It offers a small increase and that is a reasonable compromise.
Keep in mind that EU Member States and citizens have to cut their budgets.
Unfortunately, the debate on the budget had a false start.
The Parliament demanded an increase of 6%, which was ludicrous and showed that this congregation was out of touch.
Here, the debate was even inflamed by hotheads who wanted to kidnap the budget to force access to own resources, in other words, EU taxation.
We have always opposed that.
Lisbon is clear on it.
The Parliament has a right to advise, not a right to codecide.
The Parliament lost this battle, as we predicted.
Now it is moving to the position which the European Conservatives defended all along – a budget of 1% of GDP.
The hotheads here must cool down, particularly the Greens.
Just imagine that the EU had no budget next year while the euro was in a tailspin.
Is that the image you want to offer the financial markets?
They would not be at all happy.
I would like to congratulate the governments of the United Kingdom and the Netherlands for their principled position.
I thank the Belgian Government for their role as honest broker and I thank the Commission for its knowledgeable and cool-headed work.
Madam President, I would like to welcome the High Representative to the European Parliament today.
I would also like to warmly congratulate Mrs Andrikienė for her work.
It was excellent team work, which is why it could be adopted nearly unanimously in the Committee on Foreign Affairs.
I was very fortunate to have been invited this autumn to participate in the discussions between the Member States on how the EU human rights policy could be made more effective and more coherent.
I believe that we have now a historic opportunity to review our human rights policy, as you have indicated, Baroness Ashton.
My suggestion is that this process should be as inclusive and as open as possible.
I would very much recommend that you send a communication in due time – not too late, of course – to Parliament and the Council, so that we can have real high-level discussion and engagement.
Today it is very important to be reminded that the Treaty of Lisbon places respect for human rights at the core of the Union ’ s external policy.
For this reason, we need to have the proper structures in place.
We know that you, the High Representative, are committed to human rights and democratic structures at headquarters.
Could we please be told what that might mean in practice?
Are you able to give us the commitment that you gave Parliament in the summer?
I would also strongly urge you to go for the decision to establish the Brussels-based COHOM, which is the EU Council working party on human rights.
If we need to have more coherence – which we do – we definitely need to have this permanent structure in place.
Lastly, I would like to thank you for your efforts in bringing the Member States together last Friday in Oslo for the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony.
I have reason to believe that, without your efforts, it would not have happened.
It is a very good basis for our human rights work so that the Union will have a clearer, louder and more effective voice in the world.
Madam President, I speak as the European Parliament ’ s Vice-President for Democracy and Human Rights and thank Ms Andrikienė for her excellent report.
In her speech Lady Ashton talked about the new structures within the EEAS – or at least she did not talk about them.
When I founded the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights many years ago, I believed it was necessary to have a structure to deliver democracy and human rights.
That still exists.
Incidentally, the Commission wanted to abolish it and mainstream human rights and democracy through all external programmes.
Lady Ashton does not talk about mainstreaming in her speech, but I fear that, when she talks about a silver thread so thin that it risks breaking at the first pressure, she is talking about a sort of filigree foreign policy.
I think we need more than that.
We would like to see – as others have said, right around the House – a directorate for human rights and democracy within the EEAS and, possibly, a special representative.
Like Mrs Hautala, I was in Oslo last week and I would like to just reflect on one single point.
There were about a thousand people – I sat just behind Mrs Pelosi – united across the Atlantic: politicians, diplomats, civil servants and NGOs, happily united around the European Union.
When there was a standing ovation, it was unanimous – no wave, no fragmented approach.
Everybody stood up, because we stood as Western civil society behind a set of principles.
So in the future, when the EU projects its soft power, it must also project principles.
We look to you, Baroness Ashton, to bring those forward.
Madam President, I would like to address an issue that has been raised by many colleagues, and that is the suppression of the rights of Christians.
I very much wish, in the name of consistency, that colleagues would be equally interested in repression of the rights of representatives of other religions, because
we are very often told by other countries that we are one-sided and biased, so I think this is a question of real coherence and credibility.
I would like the guiding line of the EU human rights foreign policy to be the avoidance of any double standards, and I hope that the European Parliament will stick to that.
Lastly, can I ask Baroness Ashton if she is going to respond to the many questions that we have about the new human rights structures in the EAS, since these will be assembled in the very near future.
Madam President, in view of the importance of human rights, I would like to have a roll-call vote on Amendment 8. It addresses the surprising and unfortunate decision by the Serbian Government not to attend the Nobel Peace Prize award ceremony in Oslo.
At the same time, the amendment praises the Serbian Ombudsman ’ s decision to attend the ceremony on behalf of the Serbian people.
It is a message to Serbia and all future candidate states that bargaining with human rights is not acceptable.
In order to have broader support for this amendment, I also want to submit a very short oral – basically compromise – amendment, originally prepared by Mrs Maria Eleni Koppa.
I want to add the word ‘ initial ’ between ‘ the government ’ s ’ and ‘ decision ’, so the wording will be ‘ Regrets the government ’ s initial decision not to attend the
Nobel Peace Prize award ceremony in Oslo on 10 December; welcomes, on the other hand, the Ombudsman ’ s initiative to attend the ceremony as a responsible and praiseworthy decision ’.
I urge all my colleagues to support this amendment.
Mr President, the plight of Christians in the Middle East, Asia and Africa is no accident.
This is not a series of regrettable but uncoordinated attacks.
On the contrary, it is classic mass persecution.
The Christians are intimidated, evicted or killed with a clear purpose: religious cleansing.
This is happening as we here in Europe are bending over backwards to accommodate the endless sensibilities of Muslim believers.
The result is a Europe full of mosques and the Middle East purged of Christians.
But this is not about numbers.
It is about liberty and identity.
Even for those among us who do not believe, Christianity should be more than a forgotten, exotic and diminishing sect.
We are free to believe or not, but we are not free to see our freedoms abused.
This approach means that we should make religious freedom a precondition in our relations with sovereign states.
This approach should be inscribed into law and become part of the High Representative ’ s mandate.
Mr President, I would like to start by congratulating the Commission on its flexibility in applying the competition rules during the current financial and economic crisis.
It is very important that the crisis is not used as a pretext to eliminate competition, and the Commission has already shown a very firm attitude against cartels, which is a good thing.
We need to make sure that there are exit mechanisms and that we come back to normal market conditions as soon as possible.
There are some areas – and you spoke about that, Commissioner – where competition can be enhanced.
These include the energy market, where regulated energy prices still distort competition; the completion of the single railway market can also bring important benefits to European travellers.
The Commission should also be particularly careful concerning competition on the medicines market, especially with regard to those practices of originator producers which restrict the entry of generic medicines.
Furthermore, I call on the Commission to be firm in securing competition between public and private hospitals by means of bold action against cross-subsidies which favour public hospitals.
The Commission needs to communicate the benefits of competition policy to consumers more effectively.
Mr President, I would like to commend the report for including a very positive mention about SEPA, the Single Euro Payments Area.
Time and again this Parliament has demanded a rapid SEPA migration, and the reasons are simple.
The Commission ’ s impact assessment quotes a study that SEPA would save EUR 300 billion in the EU economy in six years ’ time.
These savings are due to increased competition via common standards and processes.
This will also save time and stress for all Europeans who need to carry out payments in other countries.
I also strongly agree with the report when it states that the public economic support to banks and other companies in the economic crisis has distorted competition.
Like many of my colleagues here this morning, I urge the Commission to provide an analysis of these distortions.
Let me add one more thought on the need for common standards and processes.
A lot of inventions in the future will be based on information and communication technologies.
We need more competition in the ICT business, and this could be encouraged by increased use of open-source code in Europe.
I expect that Europe will, in this way, become more competitive in this crucial field in relation to the US and other major economic areas, as Mr Hökmark said previously.
Mr President, firstly, I would like to express my gratitude and give my sincerest congratulations and compliments to the rapporteur and fellow shadow rapporteurs for their good cooperation and understanding.
I would also like to thank my fellow Green Members for their cooperation and contribution.
We can finally say that we have come up with a decent document allowing us, the European Union, to proceed in a fairly reasonable manner, taking into account all the interests of all stakeholders.
Even though the Greens justifiably think that we should be even more radical, we are still glad that this report takes our worries and concerns into account, such as the proposals we made to the rapporteur concerning the fact that
scientific data clearly demonstrates that the Arctic ecosystem is currently going through massive climate-related changes and that this situation requires a precautionary and scientifically robust approach to be taken to any future development in the Arctic.
That is why we called for further scientific studies, within the framework of a multilateral agreement to be completed, to inform international understanding and decision making for the Arctic ecosystem before any further major development goes ahead.
We thank the other groups for accepting that.
This is an example of how to put things in a congenial form for our wide range of different constituencies.
There are some sceptics in this room who have stated that the Arctic region does not deserve our attention, but it does, particularly with Iceland likely to become the 28th member of the EU.
The Arctic is ‘ cool ’.
This is not because of climate change and the consequent warming up of the normally cold High North.
The Arctic is also ‘ cool ’ because of the lucrative possibilities emerging on the horizon, even though they bring with them very complex and difficult problems.
That is why I think politicians who tackle these problems in a responsible and politically subtle manner are ‘ cool ’ politicians, as are those of us who will vote for Mr Gahler ’ s report today.
Madam President, Commissioner, the importance of the Black Sea region for the EU from the transport, energy, stability, security and environmental point of view is evident.
It is for this reason that the EU strategy for this region will certainly have a very positive impact on the area and on the EU as a whole.
The Committee on Regional Development believes this strategy can bring growth and sustainable development for the region.
But also it is of the opinion that for full effectiveness, it is necessary to involve all the states of the region, no matter whether they are Member States or not.
This strategy needs actions to be coordinated – but how could this coordination exist without the proper involvement of all countries?
Coordination is certainly needed with the Danube strategy, which is soon supposed to become a major priority of the Hungarian Presidency.
The use of an integrated approach and cross-border cooperation between the regions should be promoted in all fields of the strategy but, in particular, those of transport, energy and the environment.
Mr President, I think the issue of great urgency today is the state of play in Egypt.
In 2005 I was the chairman of a small observer mission for the elections there.
We were asked to go for the first round and then for the second round, but the first round was so chaotic and impossibly badly run, so corrupt, that we decided not to return for the second round.
Egypt is a country where for 30 or so years a dictator, in the person of Mubarak, has assumed absolute power in a particularly brutal, tyrannous and arbitrary
rule and, while we all recognise the extraordinary evolution on the streets of Egypt, we also recognise in Mubarak ’ s reaction somebody who feels he has got support, not only in Egypt but elsewhere.
Now, we recognise too that the European Union does not have the Sixth Fleet.
We are only capable of projecting moral power, so when Baroness Ashton spoke, very softly, at the beginning of this debate, she unfortunately did not carry a big stick as well.
So we have to speak softly, yes, but also with one voice and I think the problem for Europe at the moment is that it is not speaking with one voice at the level of Cathy Ashton and other leaders.
This has been referred to earlier – the prime ministers of Britain, France and Germany issuing separate statements.
Let us speak together.
Let us get it absolutely straight where we stand – in support of democracy and human rights, not only in Europe but around the world, and especially at this time in the Mediterranean.
Mr President, 60 years ago revolution in the Arab world meant the end of European colonial rule.
The second revolution in the Arab world is happening now in front of our eyes.
This is the moment when the European Union has to choose whether it stands on the right side or on the wrong side of history.
The task is to help foster an independent civil society in the Arab world.
Our budget in the EU must be reviewed to address the urgent needs of Tunisia, which has suffered from a 23-year-long autocracy.
The majority of the Tunisian people have no trust in this temporary, unelected government.
A truth process in Tunisia is already beginning, but the European Union needs a truth process itself, so great has its negligence of human rights and democratic values been in the Arab world over the years.
This is truly the time for human rights.
Mr President, I do not share the opinion that an ongoing uprising in Egypt is dominantly driven by forces longing for democracy of a European style.
I see the current riots and chaos as a revolution for change that is motivated by striving for a better life.
But the crucial question for us Europeans is the threat that the dramatic situation could be abused by radical Islamists.
If there were such a dramatic political change, Europe, as well as America, would lose a moderate Arabic ally and the Egypt peace treaty would be endangered.
Egypt can quickly and easily turn into a regime that is hostile to Europe, Israel and America and become close to Hamas.
The position of the EU should stay firmly on the side of those who are striving for freedom and who relentlessly support free elections.
Madam President, I would like to inform you that democracy in Romania has never seemed under so much pressure during the last 20 years.
We have already alerted you regarding the President of the Chamber of Deputies, who falsified the vote for the all-important pensions law.
The recent case of the social democrat, Constantin Nicolescu, the Chairman of the Argeş County Council in Romania, proves once again that the methods used by the governing party in Romania brutally threaten the fundamental rights and freedoms of citizens.
All the measures adopted by the government demonstrate that the Democratic Liberal Party in Romania is at war with the entire Romanian people.
We cannot allow a democratic member of the European Union to behave undemocratically, arresting people at will and using public institutions to carry out personal vendettas.
Together we must defend our rights, our freedoms and our democracy.
Mr President, with decisive and timely action towards Libya, the EU and the Human Rights Council have indeed shown that they can take action when needed.
They can indeed.
They can show that different regional groups can come together and they can show that the Council does not need to be divided.
Today, there is no longer a reason why action on Iran, North Korea, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Burma and Sudan could not be next in line.
This time is significant for another reason.
A first comprehensive review of the working methods of the Council has come to a conclusion and, like my colleagues, I feel disappointed by the fact that the Council failed to appreciate the importance of the review.
The EU prepared itself well but failed to win the support of others.
But at least the independence of the Human Rights Commissioner and of the special procedure was not damaged, so this is already an achievement under the present conditions.
In any future discussions of the Council ’ s work, the European Union must be able to build alliances and to reach across to other partners.
It must also be willing to listen and able to compromise.
I think we had a very welcome participation by the High Representative in the meeting some weeks ago.
High Representative, I salute you for taking this step and giving a very impressive presentation there.
So to my last point: the EU ’ s performance.
After the creation of the Human Rights and Democracy Directorate at the European External Action Service, the EU delegation in Geneva will have a central role to play in EU human rights policy in the world.
It needs increased resources and its work must be integrated into all fields of EU foreign policy.
I am very honoured to be leading Parliament ’ s delegation to the Human Rights Council ’ s 16th session at this critical time next week.
Mr President, first, I would like to thank the rapporteurs for the excellent work they have done.
It is quite heartening that we are speaking with the same voice as the European Commission.
Most importantly, I would like to thank them for defending the prerogatives of this House.
To my colleagues from the ECR, I would say that this is not grandstanding but legitimately asserting our role in this process.
In times of crisis, we need effective solutions, stability and predictability, and all these features can be achieved best when we avail ourselves of the Community institutions.
Intergovernmental solutions will not, in the long run, lead us anywhere.
Most importantly, if we are serious about fighting economic crisis and being competitive, we have to do it together, regardless of whether a given Member State is a part of the euro area or outside it.
Therefore, I welcome the fact that, in our position – voted on yesterday in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs of this House – we have agreed to open the mechanism to all countries willing to participate in it, thus dispelling the ungrounded fears of a two-speed Europe.
Mr President, I rise yet again to complain about the time management of this Parliament.
Both yesterday and today, we were given a time to vote, and we have abused it yet again.
Surely, the sign of a well run and effective Parliament is one that can manage its affairs properly and to time.
Can you please urge the authorities to get a grip of this?
Otherwise, we will be treated with the contempt we deserve.
Mr President, I would not normally rise on such a point.
As a Vice-President, I respect the Chair.
However, the groups have all been told that the calendar votes, which are very limited – I think there are two amendments – will take place at the beginning of the voting session and not after Mr Schmitt has spoken to the House.
I think it is disrespectful to Mr Schmitt to allow people to go and then ask them to come back again for two votes after his speech.
I therefore ask you to put to the House the proposal to modify the agenda that all votes today take place before Mr Schmitt ’ s speech, and we start on the basis of the calendar votes.
Mr President, I am sorry to prolong this but as it happens, the voting lists have been circulated to all the groups.
If this was an error, it needs to be corrected.
It is ridiculous, and disrespectful to the President of one of our Member States and currently in the Presidency, to call the Members back to the House, back to the Chamber, after he has spoken.
Let us do it now in the order in which it is on the voting paper.
There is no justification for changing this again.
Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur Mr Schwab and his team of rapporteurs for opinions and shadow rapporteurs for their very good work on this report.
It took a long time to choose a line that would be balanced enough for both consumers and businesses.
I welcome the overall compromise that has been agreed by all political groups and I believe that this is an important step forward for all consumers in the European Union.
There are significant improvements such as the provision of clear information requirements in contracts, and the harmonisation of the provisions on the right of withdrawal.
Of course it is a compromise, it is not perfect.
An example is Article 22a which obliges the trader to deliver in other Member States.
There are products and services which due to their nature should not be covered here, namely perishable goods.
Problems might also arise with digital products.
The initial intention of promoting cross-border business is very important and is very good, and I really hope that during the forthcoming negotiations with the Council we will manage to make these adjustments to achieve an optimal result.
Mr President, I am very pleased to be having this debate today, with a view to the vote on Wednesday.
Hopefully, our work will shake the Council out of its inertia and trigger productive negotiations, allowing us to fulfil our objective of having a common European asylum system by 2012 and thus taking into consideration the hard work we have all put into this file.
I would like to warmly thank Mrs Guillaume for her excellent work and her conciliatory approach.
On the whole, the result is a good text which includes significant improvements with respect to the asylum procedures currently implemented in the EU, which vary enormously from Member State to Member State.
To name but a few, new provisions have been introduced to ensure each applicant is provided with adequate means to substantiate his or her claims in order to reach an asylum decision
within a six-month period, such as the personal interview and free advice on procedural and legal aspects in first-instance procedures, including the preparation of the necessary procedural documents.
Mr President, let me first thank our rapporteur, Mrs Giannakou, and the Commission for their excellent cooperation and for an excellent report.
Are we really in a process of creating a European as my honourable colleague Mr Hannan just told us?
I do not know, I am not venturing that far.
I think what we want to do at this particular moment is to strengthen the nascent European public space and basically invigorate the debate on European issues.
I mean, the idea in this House is to bring European citizens closer to what we are discussing here and what could be simpler then basically starting to discuss European issues with them.
By the way, I can only speak for myself, but I am no bureaucrat – I am a directly elected member of this House.
The debate is actually to increase the visibility of European political parties, to which we all belong regardless of whether we are sitting on the Left, in the Centre or on the Right of this House.
To bring them out of the shade, because at the moment no one really knows what they do, what is their status, whether they produce any added value – and we in the EPP believe that they do.
That is the possibility, to actually have some programme presentation and in the future hopefully to fight European elections on European issues and not get bogged down in national rhetoric all the time.
This report is positive on three counts.
First of all, it brings a certain balance between operational authority within the parliamentary groups and a clear link with what we do in this House, linking funding to presence in this House – in the European Parliament.
Secondly, it brings organisational convergence between European political parties and European foundations, which is quite laudable, and thirdly it tightens and clarifies the funding of European political parties, which I think should be the goal for us all.
Mr President, last night, I helped to organise a hearing of experts from the region who told us that in Bahrain, the deaths so far at the hands of
the security forces have been at least 23; in Syria, 132; and in Yemen, at least 63. It may be asked: what can the EU do?
Well, our resolution which will be adopted tomorrow makes some suggestions.
However, I have to say that in previous months, the European Parliament has passed resolutions on Tunisia, Egypt and Libya, and my office has made a comparison between those resolutions and the actions of the Commission, its blueprint for change, and it does not give me much courage.
We are wasting our words here unless the Commission listens to us and unless the Council listens.
So, as I say, I am publishing this analysis on my website.
I believe that the Lisbon Treaty gave the European Parliament additional responsibilities.
We must be taken seriously by the other elements in the foreign policy of the European Union. Especially at a time of massive change in the Arab world, we all need to work together.
Mr President, we have heard that Parliament is now very serious about tackling the serious human rights violations in the three countries: Bahrain, Yemen and Syria.
We need to hear from the European External Action Service, we need to hear from the Commission how we can show that we are no longer working on the basis of double standards.
We have been told about very many concrete measures.
We need to hear how the operations in the UN Human Rights Council are proceeding.
Is the European Union united in the call for special sessions on Syria, Bahrain and Yemen?
We have heard that it is time to stop exporting weapons to these countries.
We cannot wait, so please, what are the European External Action Service and the Commission going to do about these things now?
Mr President, EU citizens have a right to know the make-up of the clothes they wear and this regulation will allow them to avoid purchasing products containing non-textile parts of animal origin, whether for health, ethical or other considerations.
When used in garments, for example as trimmings, such materials are currently not subject to mandatory labelling; most consumers are unaware of this and may not know the exact make-up of the textiles they buy.
EU legislation providing for this already exists for footwear, and it makes sense to provide our consumers with the same level of information when they buy their clothes.
Allergy sufferers in particular stand to gain from this proposal, as fur is potentially hazardous to their health, and the Commission must also study the possibility that potentially hazardous materials and chemicals used in textiles may lead to allergic reactions.
Future applications of new textile fibre names must include available scientific data on possible allergic reactions and other adverse effects on human health.
It should be stressed that these are balanced proposals which exempt clothes made by self-employed tailors from such labelling requirements.
Mr President, my comments are for Baroness Ashton.
Vice-President / High Representative Ashton, you have very clearly heard this morning that Parliament will fully support your leadership role and is demanding that you take the initiative in our common foreign and security policy.
You have also heard the many questions by colleagues about who and which Member States are blocking our common efforts.
My suggestion to you would be that, now that the European External Action Service is putting in place its rules on access to information and access to documents, please make this a modern organisation which is accessible to citizens and which does not deal with foreign policy as if it were only the domain of some secretive diplomats.
I am sure this would be the best way to boost our common efforts for a truly common foreign and security policy.
Mr President, democracy and respect for human rights and the rule of law are an integral part of the new association agreement which is currently being negotiated between Azerbaijan and the European Union.
Without respect for these principles, it is impossible to see how Azerbaijan can have a common future with its European partners.
Let me also join those colleagues who point out that we need to be very clear and objective when we talk to our partners in the Eastern Partnership countries.
We should not believe that we can get away with simply bashing Belarus, because there are severe problems in Azerbaijan and in several other Eastern Partnership countries,
and I hope that the forthcoming study commissioned by the Subcommittee on Human Rights will give some guidance on how we should talk to these countries about their human rights situation.
Mr President, Bulgaria and Romania proved that they can guarantee the safety of the EU borders and this is fully – I repeat, fully – documented.
By the way, the officers arrested in Romania and Bulgaria were arrested for corruption.
Can anyone in this House claim that, for instance, a Dutch officer, a corrupt Dutch officer, would not be arrested for corruption in the Netherlands?
Secondly, Romania and Bulgaria did not compete to win the top prize of Transparency International.
They entered the judicial contract and fulfilled all its criteria.
Now, if somebody is trying to change the rules of the game during the game, I think this might be illegal according to EU law and is, anyway, unfair according to common sense.
Lord Dartmouth, to a large extent I agree with your view, but we also get indications from our interpreters that they cannot keep up with the pace.
Of course, when I interrupt the speaker, I always give him the additional time, so everybody is happy – the speaker is happy, you are happy that you get the interpretation, and, of course, our interpreters are happy as well.
That is the purpose of the work we are doing here.
Mr President, Ukraine is a democracy.
Therefore, we signal our concern to a partner, an ally, and a friend.
As we all know, nobody is perfect in this world, but it is in accordance with Europe ’ s political standards and norms, and also in accordance with the logic and values of democracy, that we expect the Ukrainian authorities
not to abuse their power by encouraging and holding politically motivated trials, and instead to give those who are suspects a fair trial, rather than political retribution.
Yulia Tymoshenko and other members of the former government of Ukraine, who had long been the rivals of President Yanukovych, should not be regarded as collectively, or by association, guilty and responsible for what is perceived as a liability in political practice.
First and foremost, they are all citizens of a democratic state.
By no means are we offering a defence speech here.
Instead, we are merely reminding our friends how democracy works.
Madam President, the volume of complaints regarding misleading directory companies shows that this is a serious problem for SMEs.
Rogue business directory companies are both inflicting financial damage and harassing small companies.
In the period from 2003 to mid-2008, nearly 14 000 complaints and enquiries were documented.
Hundreds of letters of complaint are still being received from new victims.
The difficulties involved in tracking down activities of this nature undermine the very functioning of the Internal Market.
Misleading practices are illegal under the Misleading and Comparative Advertising Directive and the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive.
But there is a lack of effective legal remedies and enforcement.
The Internal Market and Consumer Protection Committee, as the committee responsible for the legislation, has recently taken up this issue with the Dutch authorities, drawing their attention to fraudulent practices by a business directory company established in the Netherlands.
The answer of the Dutch authorities clearly shows that Member States are mostly concerned about what happens in their own territory.
I believe that given the cross-border nature of the problem, more cooperation between Member States on enforcement would also be absolutely crucial to stop the fraudulent practices.
The Commission could itself take a more active role in working together with the Member States on cross-border enforcement using existing EU-wide networks to facilitate cooperation between the Member States.
More emphasis should be placed on effective and dissuasive sanctions against such fraudulent practices in all Member States, which would put such directory companies out of business and enable those who run them to be punished.
It should be envisaged to extend the scope for the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive to encompass all commercial practices in a business-to-consumer relationship, whether aiming at the protection of consumers or competitors.
In that way, most if not all unfair business-to-business commercial practices in the retail sector would be covered and governed by the same set of rules as unfair business-to-consumer commercial practices, with which they generally overlap.
It is also important to help businesses combat the scam by improving access to information and awareness raising by improving redress mechanisms.
I wish to ask the Commissioner: what are the major obstacles for stronger involvement of state authorities in cross-border enforcement cooperation, and what measures does the Commission envisage in the fight against rogue directory companies?
Madam President, the European Parliament has received hundreds of petitions from small businesses across the EU who claim to have fallen victim to these schemes.
While paying these outrageous fees may put innocent companies under severe financial hardship, the victims are often too small to afford the legal costs of bringing actions against these directory companies.
These companies often target victims that are based in another Member State.
This creates legal uncertainty for the victims, as they often do not know what the legal status is of such contracts in another country.
The directory companies play on that uncertainty.
Whilst the Commission has clearly stated that the directive on misleading and comparative advertising outlaws the misleading practices of these directory companies, it must also look at the transposing of that directive by the Member States in order to clarify whether citizens are protected equally across Europe.
The fact that this directive has been transposed by Member States does not necessarily mean that these measures are either comprehensive or in conformity with one another.
