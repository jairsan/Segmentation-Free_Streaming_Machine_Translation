Madam President, the report refers to the future of cohesion policy.
It was difficult to find pragmatic answers valid for all 27 Member States and their different governance and partnership systems.
The rapporteur has managed to come up with very concrete proposals.
On governance, I would like to underline two elements.
We need to empower regional and local authorities with a better and more efficient sharing of responsibilities.
It is also of the utmost importance to address the lack of expertise and administrative capacity to deal with funds and projects at regional and local level.
On partnership, the report rightly insists on the centrality of inclusive processes and full ownership.
We need to bring in the largest number of stakeholders possible at all policy and implementation stages, and in order to do this we need minimum compulsory standards.
I am extremely satisfied with the way in which the rapporteur has dealt with all our contributions and concerns and congratulate him once again for his excellent work.
