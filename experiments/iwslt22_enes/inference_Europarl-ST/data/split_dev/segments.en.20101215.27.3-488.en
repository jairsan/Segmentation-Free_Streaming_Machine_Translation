Madam President, I would like to welcome the High Representative to the European Parliament today.
I would also like to warmly congratulate Mrs Andrikienė for her work.
It was excellent team work, which is why it could be adopted nearly unanimously in the Committee on Foreign Affairs.
I was very fortunate to have been invited this autumn to participate in the discussions between the Member States on how the EU human rights policy could be made more effective and more coherent.
I believe that we have now a historic opportunity to review our human rights policy, as you have indicated, Baroness Ashton.
My suggestion is that this process should be as inclusive and as open as possible.
I would very much recommend that you send a communication in due time – not too late, of course – to Parliament and the Council, so that we can have real high-level discussion and engagement.
Today it is very important to be reminded that the Treaty of Lisbon places respect for human rights at the core of the Union ’ s external policy.
For this reason, we need to have the proper structures in place.
We know that you, the High Representative, are committed to human rights and democratic structures at headquarters.
Could we please be told what that might mean in practice?
Are you able to give us the commitment that you gave Parliament in the summer?
I would also strongly urge you to go for the decision to establish the Brussels-based COHOM, which is the EU Council working party on human rights.
If we need to have more coherence – which we do – we definitely need to have this permanent structure in place.
Lastly, I would like to thank you for your efforts in bringing the Member States together last Friday in Oslo for the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony.
I have reason to believe that, without your efforts, it would not have happened.
It is a very good basis for our human rights work so that the Union will have a clearer, louder and more effective voice in the world.
