Mr President, we, as Liberals, are against the death penalty in general, but here the death penalty in China is used to oppress minorities, like the Tibetans, the Uighurs and others.
Furthermore, China is not a democracy.
Human rights are not respected.
China has a harsh policy against Taiwan.
China should be put under pressure.
This is difficult, I know.
It is an enormous market, but we should fight for our principles.
Therefore, we support this resolution.
