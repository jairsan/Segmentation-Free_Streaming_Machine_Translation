Mr President, firstly, I would like to thank Mr Coelho for his excellent work.
Although we all have different political opinions, he did his best in order to achieve a compromise.
The Verts / ALE Group strongly opposes the extensive introduction of biometrics until its necessity is proven beyond a reasonable doubt.
We believe that it has crucial implications for personal data safety and for fundamental rights.
We voted against biometrics in visas.
We are also against biometrics in European passports.
We see the current proposal as a possible way of establishing limits for fingerprinting people for a travel document.
Therefore, we are satisfied that the compromise with the Commission and the Council is achieved, the age limit of 12 years is established for those Member States where fingerprinting of children does not take place and the age limit of six years is established for other Member States.
I would like to stress once again that our support for age limits does not mean that we support fingerprinting as such.
We strongly believe that biometrics in passports can be used only for verifying the authenticity of the document or the identity of the holder.
Use of such data for other purposes, such as law enforcement, is neither legitimate nor proportional.
We cannot agree that everyone holding the European passport is a usual suspect whose fingerprints are to be stored.
That is our position, but I would like to stress once more than we congratulate Mr Coelho and the Commission and Council on this compromise.
