Mr President, I would not normally rise on such a point.
As a Vice-President, I respect the Chair.
However, the groups have all been told that the calendar votes, which are very limited – I think there are two amendments – will take place at the beginning of the voting session and not after Mr Schmitt has spoken to the House.
I think it is disrespectful to Mr Schmitt to allow people to go and then ask them to come back again for two votes after his speech.
I therefore ask you to put to the House the proposal to modify the agenda that all votes today take place before Mr Schmitt ’ s speech, and we start on the basis of the calendar votes.
