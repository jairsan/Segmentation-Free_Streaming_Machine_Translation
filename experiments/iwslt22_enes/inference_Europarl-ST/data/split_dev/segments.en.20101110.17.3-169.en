Madam President, we are debating tonight what I believe might be the most important act for the EU in the years to come.
It is within the context of reforming the single market that we have the real opportunity to transform Europe into a more social and sustainable Union, so the question is: does this communication manage to point towards a more green and socially just internal market?
I believe we are not quite there yet.
Let me give you two examples; firstly proposal 29. Here I have to ask you, Mr Barnier, where is the guarantee for the right to strike?
Where is the guarantee that fundamental social rights will not be overthrown by the freedoms of the market?
I am aware that there are different positions within the Commission on this question and I would like to ask you very directly: is it true that among others, the Danish, Swedish, German and British Commissioners have fought against your proposal to introduce a social clause?
If this is so, Commissioner, you should know that you have the backing of this House, because achieving such guarantees would be true reconciliation.
A second example of something that needs to be improved is proposal 19, the introduction of a Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base.
We Greens have been asking for this for a long time and should therefore be happy.
But the problem for us arises when we read the text.
It says that the CCCTB should aim at removing fragmentation for business.
Listen.
I believe that the major problem with company taxes in Europe is not fragmentation, but unhealthy ongoing downward competition between Member States.
This has been going on for 15 years now.
No wonder that we have problems financing our welfare at this time.
I believe the aim of a CCCTB should be to put an end to unhealthy competition in Europe.
That is the real problem.
Furthermore, I think we need to go beyond the proposal right now on greening the internal market, for example, by using green procurement.
I believe we can achieve much more there.
So, Mr Barnier, I believe we have work to do.
I am looking forward to that and thank you for inviting us to join in this very broad discussion.
We appreciate that.
