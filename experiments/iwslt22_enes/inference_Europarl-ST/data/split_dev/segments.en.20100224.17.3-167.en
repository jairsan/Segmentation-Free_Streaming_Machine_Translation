Mr President, there is guilt on both sides, but an overreaction on the part of Israel over this report and indeed over Operation Cast Lead.
Goldstone is a respected judge of considerable repute, and Jewish.
There are undoubtedly flaws in this report, but Israel must recognise that the core of the criticism is based on fact.
You only have to listen to Israeli soldiers who admit to their dubious activities on occasions in the organisation ‘ Breaking the Silence ’.
Israel has been forced to admit the use of white phosphorous as a result of this inquiry, so why has there been no real investigation into the actions of some of their soldiers who have been involved in potential, if not actual, war crimes?
The PLC has admitted its transgressions, but Israel on this issue and on the recent Dubai assassination must cease to be so arrogant and recognise the justified concern of sensible decent people throughout the world.
