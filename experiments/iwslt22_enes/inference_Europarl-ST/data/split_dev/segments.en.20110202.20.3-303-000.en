Madam President, I would like to inform you that democracy in Romania has never seemed under so much pressure during the last 20 years.
We have already alerted you regarding the President of the Chamber of Deputies, who falsified the vote for the all-important pensions law.
The recent case of the social democrat, Constantin Nicolescu, the Chairman of the Arge≈ü County Council in Romania, proves once again that the methods used by the governing party in Romania brutally threaten the fundamental rights and freedoms of citizens.
All the measures adopted by the government demonstrate that the Democratic Liberal Party in Romania is at war with the entire Romanian people.
We cannot allow a democratic member of the European Union to behave undemocratically, arresting people at will and using public institutions to carry out personal vendettas.
Together we must defend our rights, our freedoms and our democracy.
