Lord Dartmouth, to a large extent I agree with your view, but we also get indications from our interpreters that they cannot keep up with the pace.
Of course, when I interrupt the speaker, I always give him the additional time, so everybody is happy â€“ the speaker is happy, you are happy that you get the interpretation, and, of course, our interpreters are happy as well.
That is the purpose of the work we are doing here.
