Mr President, I have prepared a short statement for today, which I should like to read.
It is a great honour for me to be nominated Vice-President of the European Parliament with the support of the European People ’ s Party.
It was a similar honour to receive the highest state decoration of Romania, the Order of the Star, in
December 2009, at the commemoration of the 20th anniversary of the fall of Communist dictatorship in Romania.
Twenty years ago in Timişoara, people of diverse ethnic backgrounds and different beliefs, united by understanding and courage and facing and running the same risks together, rose up against the Ceauşescu regime.
In the same way as back then, I continue my efforts today to represent my country ’ s interests in the spirit of the
fight for human, minority and religious rights and for freedom, while remaining committed to European and Christian values.
I am committed to furthering the European integration of former Communist countries and nations in the Eastern and Central European region,
in particular, that of the Hungarian minority community in Romania that I represent as a member of the European People ’ s Party.
It fills me with joy to be a Member of the European Parliament in the period following the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, which marks a new beginning in the history of a United Europe.
Thank you for your attention.
