Madam President, I should like to thank Mr Lagendijk, whose great political skills have produced a wonderful resolution for us to work from.
I thank him particularly for accepting paragraph 26, to which I wish to draw the Minister ’ s and the Commission ’ s attention.
Here we note the exceptional ill-health of 1 500 Roma people, who are sitting on the edge of a lead mine and have been there through UN misjudgement for nine years.
I fully accept that, as Minister Vondra has said, this is perhaps not quite the mission of the European Union.
Nonetheless, I thank the Commission team for picking up this topic immediately I raised it and for visiting and for seeing the damage that the lead levels have caused.
These people have monstrous lead levels in their blood, irreversible damage, and need immediate and urgent relocation and medical treatment.
Minister Vondra, you promised that you would keep this Parliament fully briefed.
May I ask you, as President-in-Office, to give this matter your profoundest attention and to tell me what you do.
