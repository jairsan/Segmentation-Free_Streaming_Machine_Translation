Mr President, I welcome the idea of a strategy for the Black Sea region as a pilot project for the macro-regional strategies.
Initiatives of this kind allow the coordination of EU policy instruments in order to have a coherent, stable and sustainable development of the regions involved.
On the occasion of the last Council, it was said that a strategy would have been developed for the Black Sea region by the end of 2009.
This is an extremely important initiative as it can bring about harmonised development and prosperity for the region that, in comparison with the Black Sea area, is far more complex in terms of actors involved and relevant for security, stability, energy and the environment.
So I would like to ask the Swedish Presidency when such a strategy for the Black Sea region will be delivered, and when Parliament will be informed and involved in this issue.
