Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur Mr Schwab and his team of rapporteurs for opinions and shadow rapporteurs for their very good work on this report.
It took a long time to choose a line that would be balanced enough for both consumers and businesses.
I welcome the overall compromise that has been agreed by all political groups and I believe that this is an important step forward for all consumers in the European Union.
There are significant improvements such as the provision of clear information requirements in contracts, and the harmonisation of the provisions on the right of withdrawal.
Of course it is a compromise, it is not perfect.
An example is Article 22a which obliges the trader to deliver in other Member States.
There are products and services which due to their nature should not be covered here, namely perishable goods.
Problems might also arise with digital products.
The initial intention of promoting cross-border business is very important and is very good, and I really hope that during the forthcoming negotiations with the Council we will manage to make these adjustments to achieve an optimal result.
