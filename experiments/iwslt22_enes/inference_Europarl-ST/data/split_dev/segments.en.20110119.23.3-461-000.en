Mr President, the plight of Christians in the Middle East, Asia and Africa is no accident.
This is not a series of regrettable but uncoordinated attacks.
On the contrary, it is classic mass persecution.
The Christians are intimidated, evicted or killed with a clear purpose: religious cleansing.
This is happening as we here in Europe are bending over backwards to accommodate the endless sensibilities of Muslim believers.
The result is a Europe full of mosques and the Middle East purged of Christians.
But this is not about numbers.
It is about liberty and identity.
Even for those among us who do not believe, Christianity should be more than a forgotten, exotic and diminishing sect.
We are free to believe or not, but we are not free to see our freedoms abused.
This approach means that we should make religious freedom a precondition in our relations with sovereign states.
This approach should be inscribed into law and become part of the High Representative â€™ s mandate.
