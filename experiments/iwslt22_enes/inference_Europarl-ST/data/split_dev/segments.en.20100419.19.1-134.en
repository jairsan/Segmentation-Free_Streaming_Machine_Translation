Madam President, the Chair of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, Mr Simpson, is not able to join us today and has asked me to read out his statement.
The recast on the development of the guidelines of the TEN-T network seeks to bring together the various amendments adopted over the years to the guidelines and to incorporate amendments that take account of the enlargement of the EU to 27 Member States.
To give a bit of background to the report, the guidelines give direction to the development of the Trans-European transport network.
The objective is to establish the network gradually by 2020 by integrating land, sea and air transport infrastructure networks throughout the Union.
Turning back to the report at hand, it is, strictly speaking, a codification of the legislative text, but, because the Commission made some minor changes to the annex, they were forced to do it via the recast procedure.
The changes to the annex are to correct initial mistakes that were made during the accession of the 10 new Member States that joined in 2004.
The changes are not about updating the maps or making any substantive changes. The two changes the rapporteur has introduced to the report involve minor modifications in the recitals and some technical corrections to the maps.
These are in line with the changes made by the Council and in line with correcting the guidelines.
Following the Commission â€™ s advice, the decision was taken, both by Council and by Mr Simpson as rapporteur with the backing of the Transport Committee, not to make any substantive changes to the guidelines.
The rapporteur is, however, aware that the Greens have retabled their own amendments seeking to update the line between Munich city and Munich airport, but the rapporteur would like to reiterate the point that the changes we are making in this report are about correcting the text, not updating it.
The point of this recast is to bring everything into order ahead of the real revision of the guidelines during early 2011.
It is important to ensure the clarity of the guidelines in preparation for the more substantial changes that will take place next year.
We are all eagerly awaiting the real revision of the guidelines and the chance to further develop the TEN-T network but, in order to get to that stage, we need to get the current legislation right, and that is what we have done here.
