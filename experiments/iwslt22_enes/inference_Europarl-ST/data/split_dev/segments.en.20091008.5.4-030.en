Mr President, in my opinion, freedom of the press in a country can only be properly assessed by considering every aspect of the question.
This should include a thorough analysis of the markets, including the advertising markets, and of the habits of the population, like the average time spent watching TV, distribution of the printed press and levels of literacy, etc. We would notice certain spectacular differences in those factors in Italy compared to many other Member States.
As long as these outstanding differences, for example, concentration of media ownership and party political power over the public media, are not openly discussed, the Italian pattern will insidiously convince many people.
I would like to compare it to a virus – not dangerous enough to kill the bearer, but definitely weakening him and with the potential to infect others.
Members of the European Parliament present should know that in Estonia, one centre-left party has recklessly followed the current Italian model by concentrating all public and private resources under the party ’ s command and spreading unilateral messages all over the capital city of Tallinn.
I would have nothing against a European discussion on that issue here as well.
That is why, unlike the PPE Group, I believe it is time to discuss the freedom of the press and to adopt a resolution.
The resulting resolution should not be considered some kind of settling of scores between political parties in one or other Member State but rather should be viewed as an opportunity to promote the values on which our Union is based.
