Mr President, at the heart of this directive is the problem of control and of costing.
How can we ensure that laws adopted by the EU as a whole are applied, and how can we legislate without knowing the cost of what we want?
The rapporteur wants to bring in a universal system of uniform emission limits, which would have to be worked out in a huge bureaucratic exercise that would take at least eight years.
No one knows how much it would cost – it is called the European safety net.
I tabled Amendment 134 on staying outside the high-emission industries with standards based on best available techniques, leaving the implementation of such measures to the discretion of the Member States.
That is realistic and affordable and observes the principle of subsidiarity.
If the European safety net is adopted, I hope the Council and the Commission put pressure on Parliament to have an impact assessment done on the idea.
The question is whether we have the will to make a uniform European Union-wide system – a European safety net – work.
The answer is that all the evidence so far shows that Member States lack that will.
They will not support a European environment inspectorate: they want to stick with national enforcement agencies.
The right answer to our quandary is not to invent a huge new bureaucracy that will never spring into life, but to use our money to bring up the standards of morale of national enforcement agencies to do their job in helping to put EU law into practice.
I commend to you Amendment 129, which exempts standby generators in healthcare facilities from pollution controls that would treat them as though they were operating 100% of their time.
That amendment will save money at a critical time for health budgets.
I commend to you the amendments on large combustion plants: unless we get these into the directive, my country will face power blackouts.
People have enough to blame the EU for without that! My final point concerns compromises and Mr Turmes ’ s attack on me: the first reading is not a time for compromises, but rather a time when we fire off all our amendments and ideas and discuss them.
We cannot have compromises that prevent discussion.
Finally, I commend to the future Parliament the current Rule 55, which would allow us to have a renewed first reading of this very important directive.
It seems wrong to have the first reading in the old Parliament and the second reading, without a first reading, in the new one.
