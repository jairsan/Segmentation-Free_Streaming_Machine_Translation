Mr President, the directive that we are discussing aims to limit animal tests and improve the conditions of animals used for research.
In Europe, we already have the highest animal welfare standards in the world and this directive will raise those standards even further.
That is very commendable.
Nonetheless, we must bear in mind that human beings and their prosperity mean more than the well-being of animals, and that there is a fundamental difference in dignity between animals and human beings.
I appreciate the balance between stricter rules on animal welfare and the use of animals, while still allowing research under strict conditions.
I support the ‘ three Rs ’ principle: replace animal tests whenever possible with other methods; reduce the number of animals used to a minimum; and refine standards for breeding, accommodation and care.
Animal tests will only be allowed when no alternative method is available.
At the same time, medical research will still be possible.
That will provide a balance between the ethical necessity of the reduction of animal testing and the requirements of modern medical research.
Here, I would like to strongly oppose alternative methods to animal testing that might include tests based on the use of human embryonic stem cells.
I am concerned about those Member States whose domestic laws do not explicitly exclude from compulsory alternative testing those methods which involve the use of human embryos.
When this directive comes into force, Member States might be obliged to ensure that these alternative methods are applied, whether or not they are based on stem cells from embryos.
I will therefore abstain in the final vote, and call on Member States to provide for alternatives other than those involving the destruction of human life.
