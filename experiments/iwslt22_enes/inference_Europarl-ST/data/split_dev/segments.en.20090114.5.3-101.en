Mr President, I agree with the position that Mr Speroni has put forward.
I recognise the difficulty you are in, but I would suggest that he is right.
The screens do record every vote.
To read out every amendment result would be very time-consuming – especially with a vote like we have today.
I would suggest that you ask the Bureau to remit it to the relevant committee, and we will consider it for a future voting session – if that is acceptable to the House.
