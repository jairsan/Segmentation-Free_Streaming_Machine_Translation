Madam President, Commissioner, the importance of the Black Sea region for the EU from the transport, energy, stability, security and environmental point of view is evident.
It is for this reason that the EU strategy for this region will certainly have a very positive impact on the area and on the EU as a whole.
The Committee on Regional Development believes this strategy can bring growth and sustainable development for the region.
But also it is of the opinion that for full effectiveness, it is necessary to involve all the states of the region, no matter whether they are Member States or not.
This strategy needs actions to be coordinated â€“ but how could this coordination exist without the proper involvement of all countries?
Coordination is certainly needed with the Danube strategy, which is soon supposed to become a major priority of the Hungarian Presidency.
The use of an integrated approach and cross-border cooperation between the regions should be promoted in all fields of the strategy but, in particular, those of transport, energy and the environment.
