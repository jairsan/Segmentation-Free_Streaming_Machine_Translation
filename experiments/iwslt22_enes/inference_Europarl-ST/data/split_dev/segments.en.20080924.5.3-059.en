Mr President, it is always a pleasure to speak on matters which will enhance the steady growth of one of the most important international relationships in the globe, that between the European Union and the Republic of India.
We call, in our resolution, for those involved in the summit to explore further ways of upgrading this relationship, and we look forward to concrete results which will be reported back to this Parliament.
It is a critical time for the summit.
We paid tribute in our resolution to the September victims of terrorism in India, including those killed in the assault on the Indian Embassy in Kabul.
But today, surely, we must also pay tribute to those heroes who saved lives in Islamabad, and we must remember that India lies at the heart of a region that is in considerable security difficulties.
It is proper that the wish in our resolution that there should be greater intelligence-sharing should be taken up and honoured, and all efforts to support India in her fight against terrorism with us should be supported – including, we believe, a seat on the United Nations Security Council.
In our resolution we call also for a peaceful future for the former princely State of Jammu and Kashmir, on both sides of the border and now split into two nations.
Peace comes, as we know so well with the European Union, with employment – with jobs – and it is particularly pleasant to learn that India is at present, in Jammu and Kashmir,
building the longest railway tunnel in the globe, which will be nearly 11 km long, as part of a 148-km long section of track.
This will be the longest in the world, 95% complete, which gives 3 900 new jobs of direct employment and, I am sure, many thousands more to come.
And culture: we call, too, for greater links with culture.
This is the year of dialogue, and India has much to teach the European Union on this.
We call for more people-to-people dialogue, and I am sure that is the way forward.
In conclusion, I urge colleagues to support this excellent resolution.
