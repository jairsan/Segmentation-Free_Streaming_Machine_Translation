Madam President, on a point of order.
We have yet again a further example of the ludicrous mismanagement of the affairs of this Chamber.
It is about time that the presidency realised that when votes are to be held they should be held at the time promulgated, and no one is more important than the exercise of our democratic rights during votes.
I ask you, please, to raise, at the presidency, how our affairs are managed, so that that they can be improved and we vote at the right time and speeches are kept to the right length.
