Madam President, I speak as the European Parliament ’ s Vice-President for Democracy and Human Rights and thank Ms Andrikienė for her excellent report.
In her speech Lady Ashton talked about the new structures within the EEAS – or at least she did not talk about them.
When I founded the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights many years ago, I believed it was necessary to have a structure to deliver democracy and human rights.
That still exists.
Incidentally, the Commission wanted to abolish it and mainstream human rights and democracy through all external programmes.
Lady Ashton does not talk about mainstreaming in her speech, but I fear that, when she talks about a silver thread so thin that it risks breaking at the first pressure, she is talking about a sort of filigree foreign policy.
I think we need more than that.
We would like to see – as others have said, right around the House – a directorate for human rights and democracy within the EEAS and, possibly, a special representative.
Like Mrs Hautala, I was in Oslo last week and I would like to just reflect on one single point.
There were about a thousand people – I sat just behind Mrs Pelosi – united across the Atlantic: politicians, diplomats, civil servants and NGOs, happily united around the European Union.
When there was a standing ovation, it was unanimous – no wave, no fragmented approach.
Everybody stood up, because we stood as Western civil society behind a set of principles.
So in the future, when the EU projects its soft power, it must also project principles.
We look to you, Baroness Ashton, to bring those forward.
