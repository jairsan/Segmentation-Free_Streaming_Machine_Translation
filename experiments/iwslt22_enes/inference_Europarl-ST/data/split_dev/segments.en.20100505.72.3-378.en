Madam President, I strongly disagree with the previous speaker.
This House had to answer a question on whether or not we should convene a convention to decide that issue, and we have taken a decision not to do so, but we have done so out of respect for this instrument – for this new instrument, which actually increases the legitimacy of all the decisions which we make.
Obviously that does not set a precedent for the future, because all the really important issues concerning the changes to the Treaty, such as for example the electoral procedure, would require the convening of a convention.
Let me thank Íñigo and the coordinators for taking the decision.
It was not easy.
We had a problem with designating an additional 18 Members of this House because certain Member States did not actually plan for a procedure, but we decided that
representativeness is the most important issue, that this is the principle which we should be guided by and that this House should have a balanced representation as quickly as possible.
That is why we took a pragmatic solution, prompting Member States to complete their election procedures as quickly as possible, provided, obviously, that all the parliamentarians who are going to join us are going to be directly elected.
