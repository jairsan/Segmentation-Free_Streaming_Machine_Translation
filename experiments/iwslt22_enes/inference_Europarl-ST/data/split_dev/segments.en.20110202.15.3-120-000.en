Mr President, I think the issue of great urgency today is the state of play in Egypt.
In 2005 I was the chairman of a small observer mission for the elections there.
We were asked to go for the first round and then for the second round, but the first round was so chaotic and impossibly badly run, so corrupt, that we decided not to return for the second round.
Egypt is a country where for 30 or so years a dictator, in the person of Mubarak, has assumed absolute power in a particularly brutal, tyrannous and arbitrary
rule and, while we all recognise the extraordinary evolution on the streets of Egypt, we also recognise in Mubarak ’ s reaction somebody who feels he has got support, not only in Egypt but elsewhere.
Now, we recognise too that the European Union does not have the Sixth Fleet.
We are only capable of projecting moral power, so when Baroness Ashton spoke, very softly, at the beginning of this debate, she unfortunately did not carry a big stick as well.
So we have to speak softly, yes, but also with one voice and I think the problem for Europe at the moment is that it is not speaking with one voice at the level of Cathy Ashton and other leaders.
This has been referred to earlier – the prime ministers of Britain, France and Germany issuing separate statements.
Let us speak together.
Let us get it absolutely straight where we stand – in support of democracy and human rights, not only in Europe but around the world, and especially at this time in the Mediterranean.
