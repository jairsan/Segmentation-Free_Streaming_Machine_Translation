Mr President, first of all, please let me express my sincere sorrow for the huge tragedy that hit Taiwan on 8
August and in particular for all the people that were killed by the incredible energy of the devastation from this major disaster.
Morakot was the deadliest typhoon to hit Taiwan in nearly 50 years, ravaging the island in early August and leaving about 700 people dead or missing, forcing the evacuation of thousands and burying hundreds of village homes in mudslides.
On this occasion China showed great sensitivity by sending immediate aid to help Taiwanese victims.
Not only was the Chinese Government ready to assist the island, but also private companies and organisations of different kinds including the Association for Relations across the Taiwan Straits and the mainland Red Cross Society.
Also, the Chinese population afforded help with fundraising events organised to relieve the island from the disaster.
According to the last figures, the Chinese mainland has so far donated to the typhoon victims about a CNY 1 billion, which is the equivalent of nearly USD 150 million.
An important role in this situation was played by the several hundreds of prefabricated houses that were sent from China to Taiwan in order to put a roof over those who had lost their dwellings.
I would like to underline the fact that the European Union, attached to the One China policy, welcomes the help that China offered Taiwan on this tragic
occasion because this shows an improvement in the relations between the two territories, and it is clear that an improvement in such relations can lead to greater stability in this region.
I also think, and with this I conclude, that, given the dimension of the disaster, the European Union should make use of one of its
core values – solidarity – and offer Taiwan additional material and financial assistance in order to help with the massive task of reconstruction.
