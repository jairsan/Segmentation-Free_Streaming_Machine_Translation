Mr President, I want to raise the case of Mr John Zafiropoulos, who is in prison in Greece.
His family, who are my constituents, are convinced of his innocence.
At the beginning of this year, I wrote to the Minister of Justice in Athens raising the case.
I did not get a reply, so in a one-minute speech here in May in this Hemicycle I raised the question.
Immediately after I had spoken, the Greek Permanent Representation rushed to my office and promised me an immediate reply from the Minister in person.
Four months later: nothing.
If the Greek Permanent Representation is listening to us now in the Hemicycle, I would like to express my surprise and dismay that nothing has happened.
Would they please get me a reply from the Minister and look at the case of Mr John Zafiropoulos again?
