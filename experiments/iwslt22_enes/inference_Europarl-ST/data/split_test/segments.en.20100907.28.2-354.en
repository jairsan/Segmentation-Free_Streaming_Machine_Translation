Mr President, I thank my colleague, Manfred Weber, for accepting this question.
You said that freedom of movement is not limitless in Europe – and you are juridically right – but that it can be restricted on an individual basis.
What evidence do you have that this kind of deportation is being performed on an individual basis and how can you contradict the information that we have, both
from the press and from the NGOs that have been following this, that the main criterion for deportation, indeed the sole criterion, is an ethnic criterion?
