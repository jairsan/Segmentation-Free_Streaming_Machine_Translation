Mr President, Parliament â€™ s resolution is timely and important.
Thousands of people are subject to caning in Malaysia every year.
Caning is an inhuman and degrading form of punishment which should be abolished everywhere in the world.
Caning is a form of torture.
According to Amnesty International, a Muslim woman was caned last year in Malaysia where Sharia law is applied.
The reason for the punishment was drinking beer.
Amnesty International has also reported on the caning of refugees and immigrant workers in Malaysia.
We urge the government of Malaysia to abolish caning as a form of punishment.
We also call on the Malaysian Government to ratify the Protocol to the United Nations Convention on Torture, as well as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.
