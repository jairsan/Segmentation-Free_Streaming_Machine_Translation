Mr President, for all too long, our seas have not been truly managed but torn between conflicting economic interests.
Sometimes it is fisheries, sometimes farming, sometimes maritime transport, energy or tourism that sets the agenda.
Regional sea strategies such as the Atlantic or Baltic strategies should be a tool to coordinate and to help identify priority objectives.
We must remember that some policies such as fisheries and agriculture are mostly decided at EU level, but with environmental policies, it is Member States that are mostly responsible.
I therefore believe that the EU integrated maritime policy has an important role to play.
An efficient system of so-called marine spatial planning will be key to prioritising objectives and will guide managers, policy makers and stakeholders.
Cooperation with other States in the Atlantic region is also absolutely essential; in order, for instance, to decrease the amount of microscopic plastic debris, to fight illegal fishing or to ensure that fisheries and environmental regulations are effectively controlled and enforced.
We all depend on healthy seas and good environmental status.
That will benefit all sectoral interests, not least fisheries and tourism.
Therefore, environmental objectives are not only about the environment, but also about a prosperous Atlantic region.
