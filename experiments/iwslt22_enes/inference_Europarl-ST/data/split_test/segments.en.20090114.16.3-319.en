Mr President, for all those who observe the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, this might be a time in which we are tempted to put our hands in the air and scream in despair.
I do not think we should, however, because I think the greatest test of our humanity today is to really understand the issues at hand.
The first issue is that there can be no lasting solution to this conflict without stopping the bombardment of Israel.
The second issue is that there cannot be a lasting solution to this conflict without opening Gaza to humanitarian aid.
Indeed, President Peres has been absolutely right in saying that Gaza should be open for aid and not enclosed for rockets.
I think this is quintessential, and everyone agrees to this.
There cannot be a return to the status quo ante, and I think we could do a number of things here.
Firstly Parliament can bring both sides together to talk; secondly we should stand behind the Commission and the Council and support their efforts; and finally we should firmly support the Egyptian track of negotiations, because that is the only track that can lead to a solution and to the ceasefire which we currently all hope for.
