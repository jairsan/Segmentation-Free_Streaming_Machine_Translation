Madam President, I should like to say this to the Vice-President / High Representative: I appreciate very much what you said in your first speech on your policy and what
you have been doing with North Africa – Egypt, Tunisia, Libya – and especially the focus you put on the young people and women there, and your approach to deep democracy that has to be rooted.
I think that is essential, and all of us here in this House share that view with you, so I hope this will be successful.
On the other hand, I agree with many of my colleagues that Assad should have been included in the sanctions.
As my colleague, Danny Cohn-Bendit, asked you, who is the one – or who are the ones – who blocked it in the Council?
Is it Mr Westerwelle or who?
Tell us, and you will find support from us if you are transparent and open with us.
I think that will get support for you.
Explore your mandate.
You will have more support here from us if you tell us more about what is going on in the Council.
Go ahead and tell us.
I think that is true for coherence as well, as you and so many others here have said.
In the Albertini report that we will be voting on this week, we also call for the national policies to be supportive of the EU positions and of you, and I call on my colleagues here in the European Parliament, those of you who are from government parties in your own countries: tell your foreign ministers and your prime
ministers to support the common European policy and not just look into your own domestic interests, including in foreign policy, otherwise we will never get a common European foreign policy for which we need you, Baroness Ashton, to lead, to be ambitious and to be bold in your commitments.
61 years after the Schuman Declaration, which we celebrated two days ago, we need more Europe than ever.
What we want is very concrete: conflict prevention and civilian crisis management, Lady Ashton.
We demand that in the External Action Service, we have independent impact assessments as a standard procedure for the qualitative evaluation of the security, human rights, gender, social and economic effects of each CSDP mission and we need more civilian personnel in these missions as well.
