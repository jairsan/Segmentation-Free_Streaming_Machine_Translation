Mr President, during the last few months, the EU has experienced several changes and transitions.
We have had three Commissioners on International Trade, two EU Council Presidents and the Lisbon Treaty.
During that time, I argued with all the top officials about the need to fine-tune the South Korea-EU FTA, so as to get on board deeply dissatisfied industries, particularly the EU automotive industry.
The strongest arguments were mainly in the area of DDB safeguards and non-tariff barriers.
When the new Commissioner, in response to my question during the hearings, stated that DDB deserved a closer look, I felt optimistic.
Even the USA has shelved its FTA with South Korea partly because of similar objections from the car industry.
This is the first major FTA.
This is a template.
We need to do it right.
There must be a level playing field for both parties.
Please do not get me wrong.
I am a strong proponent of FTAs.
I understand their positive impact on GDP and employment, but we should also understand that, when the competitive advantage is one-sided, benefits will diminish and, in the worst case, could even be negative.
Employees in the EU deserve better.
Perhaps we should turn to our transatlantic partner and together demand small adjustments which would at least partially satisfy these giant industries and get new FTAs to work as soon as possible.
There will always be some unsatisfied elements but, all in all, FTAs must be beneficial to citizens of both sides.
It is my responsibility to monitor the situation and ensure that my constituents, and EU citizens, get a fair deal.
