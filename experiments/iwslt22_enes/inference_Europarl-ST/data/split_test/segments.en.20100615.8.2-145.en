Mr President, I hate to have to prolong this further.
What you said in your instructions was that people could either vote in favour or abstain.
The final results show, however, ‘ in favour ’, ‘ abstentions ’ and ‘ against ’.
I understand that there may be many people who would have voted differently if they had known they had the choice of the three.
What I would like to ask is, if indeed this is the correct way to do it, to do it one last time.
