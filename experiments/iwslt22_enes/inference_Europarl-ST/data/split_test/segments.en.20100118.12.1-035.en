Mr President, ‘ let us not allow fear to guide us ’, we often say.
Some people question whether our airport security measures are too tight.
Well, the Detroit terror attempt made us realise that our security systems are not excessively tight, but are still rather unsatisfactory.
As you all know, the Slovakian secret service placed plastic explosives in the bag of a Slovakian citizen.
The passenger, as well as the bag, got on board without any problems and landed in Ireland.
No doubt the test was spectacular, but certainly it did not strengthen the belief of citizens that security, on the one hand, and the right to privacy, on the other hand, are taken seriously by the authorities.
Citizens are flooded with conflicting information and misinterpretations in the press on a daily basis.
After Detroit, to give you an example, the spotlight is on body scanners as the best solution.
