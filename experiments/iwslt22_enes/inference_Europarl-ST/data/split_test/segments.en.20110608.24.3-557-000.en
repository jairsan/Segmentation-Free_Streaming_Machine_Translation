Madam President, we are not simply discussing domestic problems in the European Parliament.
European values are being questioned in the new Hungarian constitution.
Therefore, we have to discuss it and have to do so now.
There is still time before the adoption of the generic laws.
I hope everyone agrees that the constitution has to be balanced, close to the citizens, based on generally accepted values and principles, and should be party neutral.
Sadly, the Hungarian constitution does not fulfil these criteria.
Even the adoption of the document is questionable.
There was no, or very little, social consultation.
The text is only supported by one political party and it is opposed by major constitutional experts.
The new constitution raises questions on an international level.
For example, there is a lack of reference to EU law in the closing provisions.
We note clear differences, and comparing the text to the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the text shows inconsistencies and differences in values and principles.
The principle of good governance does not prevail in the document either.
The constitution fails to provide an EU-conforming, modern, administrative structure.
The aforementioned generic laws are very dangerous.
They make governing the country almost impossible for any future government.
We have the impression, as one of our colleagues has put it, that the government is like a football team trying to change the rules and the referee during a game.
This is not the way to treat political opponents and this is certainly not how democracy works in the 21st century in Europe.
