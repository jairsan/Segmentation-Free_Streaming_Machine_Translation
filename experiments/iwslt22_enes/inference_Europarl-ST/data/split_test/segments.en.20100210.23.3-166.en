Mr President, this amendment refers to the fact that the government in Skopje has come forward with a draft anti-discrimination law deleting sexual orientation from that whole package.
That is simply unacceptable, but I do not want to give anybody the option to vote against this amendment on human rights because of the name issue with the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, so I ask to change ‘ Macedonian Government ’ to ‘ Government of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia ’.
