Mr President, I also want to join my colleagues in the call to support the Iranian opposition and provide for better protection of refugees in Camp Ashraf.
These poor people and their families are constant targets of a brutal and vicious Iranian regime.
Adding to their plight is the daily harassment and hostile attitude of Iraqi forces who are supposed to protect them.
Madam High Representative, let us not forget these sorely tried people.
Together, we need to ensure that the EU plays a key role in their transition from persecuted opposition to a democratic government.
After all, it is in everybody ’ s interest to see – and hopefully soon – a stable and democratic Iran whose citizens enjoy the same freedom and rights as we do here in the EU.
