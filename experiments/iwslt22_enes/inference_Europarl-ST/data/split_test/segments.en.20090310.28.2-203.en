Mr President, I welcome this report, with just one or two small reservations.
We have heard from my colleague, Mrs Gill, how important small businesses are to the economy and how they are bearing the brunt of the difficulties at the moment.
The trouble is that the European Union is geared entirely for big businesses, whether it is about legislation, access to markets or funding.
We often talk about better regulation, but what we really need is proportionality.
We have to ensure that our legislation is proportional to the problems we are dealing with, and particularly in the IPPC, which we have talked about today.
It is really about big business, not about small businesses, and we should reflect that.
I welcome initiatives like JASMINE, which I think are moving us in the right direction, but we need to think in terms of funding, market access and legislation and about the specific needs of small business.
Let me make one particular plea: we have a single market but we do not have a single Community patent.
We have been at this for years and years now, and it really is a disgrace that we cannot sort out this problem.
It could, by itself, be the biggest help for businesses in the European Union.
Let us have some action.
