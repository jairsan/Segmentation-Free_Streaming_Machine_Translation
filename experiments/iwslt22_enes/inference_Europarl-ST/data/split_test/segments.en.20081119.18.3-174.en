Mr President, it seems as though Conservatives and Socialists are hand in glove with each other on the Blue Card, leaving my group lost in amazement, to be honest.
For a while now, the EU has been trying to come up with a comprehensive package on migration, including measures to tackle illegal migration as well as measures to push Europe ’ s forward-looking strategy on legal migration.
You might remember the very emotional debate on the Return Directive.
At the time, the ALDE Group said that the return policy could not be looked upon in an isolated way: it should be seen as an integral part – a necessary part – of a total package for migration, which is still very true.
Today, we finally have the chance to give a strong message on the need for better opportunities for legal migration, to address the demands of businesses in urgent need of qualified workers.
The fact that we could not expect too much from the EPP on legal migration is unfortunate but could, in a way, be foreseen.
The fact that the PSE is, broadly speaking, happily in line with the EPP on the Blue Card amendments makes my hair stand on end.
Following the vote in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, the scheme has been watered down significantly.
Far too many restrictions have been introduced, which do not help in any way when trying to make the EU more attractive to highly qualified workers.
It must be clear that the intention of the Blue Card is to increase the competitiveness of the EU economy.
The Blue Card proposal is not an easy attempt to take the best and leave the rest, thereby creating a brain drain from developing countries.
The current trend is that the vast majority of the highly qualified workers emigrate to the US, Canada or Australia instead of the EU.
If we want to reverse this trend, we have to be ambitious.
This House is about to adopt a report that would weaken an already very modest Commission proposal even further.
To be clear, the ALDE Group is a very strong supporter of the Blue Card.
However, we feel that the current text does not bring about the much-needed change for legal migration but that it confirms Member States ’ protectionist practices instead.
We all know that the Council has been excellent in making ambitious statements, but we also know that, too often, effective decision making is constrained by the inability of the Member
States to really work together in their mutual interest, and that effective decision making in this field is being undermined by a very emotional and muddled debate on legal migration, owing to a lack of focus.
The Tampere Programme, the Hague Programme, the French immigration pact, the Stockholm Programme coming up – at the end of the day, it all comes down to the transposition of these basic commitments into concrete and effective measures.
If we want the EU to benefit from the proposed scheme, we have to be ambitious and therefore I hope you will vote accordingly tomorrow.
