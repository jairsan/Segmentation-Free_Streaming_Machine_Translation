Madam President, I supported this report.
Effective consumer enforcement policy is central to the functioning of the single market.
We need to have a real and well-functioning internal market with a high level of consumer protection, which, unfortunately, is not the case today.
We have the legislation in place, but it is not enforced properly in the Member States.
Most importantly, our consumers do not feel safe because they do not know the rules and, in many cases, the compensation mechanisms are not working in the way they should.
The Commission should increase its efforts, ensuring that Member States apply directives correctly and that citizens are informed about their rights and, most importantly, that they are able to exercise those rights in practice.
