Mr President, may I ask the Prime Minister for his attention, please.
I am here, on your left, Mr Prime Minister.
I need to have a frank conversation with you.
I have a text in Portuguese but I am going to improvise in English because that was the language you used in what, for me, was the most important part of your speech, when you said: ‘ look at refugees.
Look at the refugees if you think that war and peace is not important for Europe ’.
You were addressing the new generations.
I have to admit that my heart jumped when you said that, because I am the European Parliament rapporteur for refugees.
During your Presidency, you could have done more than look at refugees.
You could have done something to help; it was not difficult.
The Council could have finished the codecision procedure which Parliament started on resettlement of refugees.
In our part of the codecision, we increased the money that we give to Member States to resettle refugees; we established categories of priorities for people who have been raped, who have been tortured and who have diseases, and who are waiting in camps to be resettled.
The Council has not completed the codecision.
It seems that it was because of Article 290 and delegated acts – something which is in the Treaty of Lisbon.
You say: ‘ look at refugees ’.
But I challenge you to do what we did, go to the al-Hol camp in Syria.
Then tell refugees to look at Article 290, look at delegated acts.
They will say: ‘ what are you talking about?
My kids are not going to school; I do not have a passport; we are stuck in a refugee camp; why are you talking about a minor institutional problem when you could have done something to help our problem?
’ This will tarnish the Belgian Presidency.
I am sorry to say this; I say it in sadness.
