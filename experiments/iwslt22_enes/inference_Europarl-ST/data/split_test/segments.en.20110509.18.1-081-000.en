Madam President, better and less expensive data transmission through high-speed broadband for all in 2020: that is an ambitious policy target, I must say, and I fully support it.
But let us face it: it will not come easily.
Nevertheless, I believe that with the Parliament ’ s first-reading position, we will be able to take a big first step towards this goal.
And let us be clear: broadband for all is not only about making sure that everyone has a Facebook profile.
It is about ensuring Europe ’ s place in the world as a leading knowledge-based economy.
If we manage to connect 500 million people, our citizens and businesses will be able to reap all of the benefits and opportunities of the digital economy.
Two things, especially, need to change if Europe is to get there.
Firstly, we need a well-functioning pro-competition telecommunications market at European level.
That is why we have introduced rules on competition-proofing.
Member States should not be allowed to allocate newly freed-up spectrum to a specific market player if that would diminish or distort competition in the market.
Secondly, we need a more efficient allocation of spectrum: an allocation that also more actively reflects today ’ s diverse demands and needs for spectrum.
That is why we are gearing this policy programme not only to free up the 800 MHz band, but also to free up additional bands amounting to at least 1 200 MHz by 2015.
Let me finish by thanking the Commission, the Commissioner, the rapporteur and my fellow shadows for their extraordinarily good cooperation; without it, this level of ambition would not have been possible.
