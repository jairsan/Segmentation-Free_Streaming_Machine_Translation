Madam President, I will be focusing my comments on the Commission budget and I would like to congratulate Mr Surján for everything he has done as the general rapporteur
but, in the absence of the coordinator of our group, Mr Bokros, who happens to be in Hungary for a long-term engagement that he was committed to, I am asked to present the group ’ s position today.
I understand that this is the third different group that I have presented views for in this House since I have been a Member – not that I have changed, just the groups have.
So the three points I would like to make in the debate today are as follows. Firstly, the general situation is a serious one, which has already been indicated in a financial and economic manner.
Our deficit levels are at historic highs in several Member States, as the President of the Council has indicated.
Indeed, in some Member States, the debate is not about where the money is going to be contributed but about the levels of cuts which will be needed to bring the expenditure back into line, as it is in my own country.
Therefore this is a very mixed debate on how we are going to make sure we can make the European Union run effectively.
Here, however, we will be looking at the budget.
In terms of the budget that we will be preparing for 2010, it is a budget which obviously is at the beginning.
We are in our opening gambits, but in our group, we will be looking very clearly at the quality of expenditure – as the Commissioner has said, on expenditure where monies can be reasonably executed and not being in any way excessive in this regard because of the general situation we find ourselves in.
My last comment relates to the comments made by our Chair in the Committee on Budgets, Alain Lamassoure.
We must use this occasion – it is the first year of a five-year Parliament – to look ahead.
We must discover, if we can, from the Commission when we are going to get the mid-term review, how it will be shaped, how we are going to be able to look ahead, not just to the mid-term review, but how we are going to approach future financial perspectives, as Mr Böge laid out in his report in the last Parliament.
Not least, how we begin to set in train an interinstitutional process that will look at long-term trends and that will enable us to get the right budgetary analysis, because without that, it is really difficult to plan ahead.
