Mr President, first of all, let me thank and congratulate Ms Kolarska-Bobinska for an excellent report and then let me start with a little story from the real world.
Ten years ago, China did not produce one single windmill; today, China houses one of the world ’ s top ten wind-energy companies.
In two years, they expect to have two companies in the top five.
Ten years ago, there was nothing.
Today, China represents 50% of global windmill production.
China is moving and they move fast.
In this light, I am sorry to say, the Commission ’ s new energy strategy is discouraging in its lack of ambition for a greener future.
We need an ambitious energy strategy for Europe, not only in a COP-16 resolution that nobody reads anyway.
We need to implement ambitious, concrete policy targets in Europe.
‘ When the time is right we can get ambitious ’ seems to be the strategy of the Council and Commission.
Well, the time is right and we cannot sit back and relax and wait for some grand international binding agreement before we act.
For an energy strategy to deliver on climate, on growth, on jobs, we need a much more ambitious and market-based approach so that we can use the market mechanism to our advantage.
It is up to ourselves to create a drive in the market, to show the pioneers where we want to go so that they can take us there.
That is why ALDE is calling for the EU to move to a 30% CO reduction target.
The carbon market, the main mechanism for our CO reductions and green investments, does not work.
It is flooded with quotas and the price is too low, so there are no incentives to invest in green technologies.
We believe that the EU needs to make this move for the sake of our economic growth, climate and energy security.
Come on Europe, come on Commission; let ’ s walk the talk.
