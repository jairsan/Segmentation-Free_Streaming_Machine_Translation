Madam President, it is difficult to stand up now after that particularly lively debate and switch to another topic! I would like to stress that the good and consistent enforcement of environmental legislation is essential for its credibility, for a level playing field and for ensuring that the environmental objectives will be met.
The issue of environmental inspections is, therefore, very important for the work of my committee, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.
On 14 November the Commission published the communication on environmental inspections in the Member States.
This communication reviewed Recommendation 2001 / 331 / EC of the European Commission, providing minimum criteria for environmental inspections.
The communication contains some worrying messages.
It states that the information submitted by the Member States on the implementation of the recommendation is incomplete or difficult to compare.
It states that there are still large differences in the way environmental inspections are being carried out in the EU.
It states that the scope of the recommendation is inadequate and that it does not include many important activities such as Natura 2000 and the control of illegal waste shipping.
It states that inspection plans have not been implemented and where they do exist that they are often not publicly available.
My committee noted with concern the conclusions from the Commission stating that the full implementation of the environmental legislation in the Community cannot be ensured.
This would not only lead to continuing damage to the environment, but also to the distortion of competition within and between the Member States.
My committee therefore formulated four questions to the Commission, which can be summarised as follows.
First, why does the Commission only wish to amend the recommendation – why does it not propose a directive on environmental inspections?
Second, why has the Commission opted instead for attaching environmental inspection requirements to existing directives individually, a process that will take a lot of time?
Third, why is the Commission not prepared to use a directive to define terms such as ‘ inspection ’ and ‘ audit ’, which are interpreted in different ways by Member States?
Fourth, why is the Commission not prepared to transform IMPEL into an effective EU environmental inspection force?
I would like to thank the Commission in advance for its reply and I would like to conclude by emphasising that, in my opinion, the implementation
and enforcement of environmental legislation should get the same political attention as the adoption of the legislation in the Commission, in the Council and in Parliament.
