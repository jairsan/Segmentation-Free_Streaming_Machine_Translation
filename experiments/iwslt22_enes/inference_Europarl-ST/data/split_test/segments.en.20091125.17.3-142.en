Mr President, this is a very important issue and I voted for this resolution because I believe that we need to have a piece of legislation protecting our citizens in case of airline bankruptcies.
Millions of our citizens use low-cost airlines every day.
However, the high number of low-cost airline bankruptcies in the European Union since 2000, and the recent case of Sky Europe, have clearly demonstrated the vulnerability of the low-cost carriers to the changing oil prices and the current difficult economic conditions.
We must rectify this situation, and we ask the Commission to consider the most adequate compensation measures for our passengers.
