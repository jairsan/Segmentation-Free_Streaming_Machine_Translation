Mr President, the March European Council confirmed the EU ’ s role as a promoter of the highest nuclear safety standards worldwide and in the EU neighbourhood.
At least two new nuclear projects at the EU ’ s external border raise serious concern, owing to a lack of transparency and of consultation with the countries affected.
New NPPs containing experimental reactors will be located in the Kaliningrad enclave in between two Member States and only 23 kilometres away from the eastern EU border in Belarus.
The EU, in cooperation with the relevant international bodies, should ensure that the developers comply with the highest nuclear safety and environmental standards right from the beginning of the development stage and should allow international nuclear experts to assess both projects, especially the site selection criteria.
The EU could effectively prevent unsafe nuclear development by refusing to contract energy that will be produced in unclean nuclear power plant stations.
What role does the Commission see in preventing unsafe nuclear development at the EU ’ s external borders?
What measures could it take?
