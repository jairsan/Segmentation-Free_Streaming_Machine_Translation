I hope that you appreciate the fact that I allowed you to speak, although what you raised was not really a point of order.
My job is not to monitor what Members decide to say.
My job is to ensure that they say it when they have the time to say it, as opposed to interrupting each other and doing so, I might add, in a rather rude and loud way.
So thank you for your comment.
I will insist, when I chair at least, that Members conduct themselves in a civil way with each other, and I will try to keep the time as best I can.
What Members say in the room, in a democratic room such as this, is their business, not mine.
