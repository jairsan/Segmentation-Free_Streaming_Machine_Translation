Mr President, I would like to speak about a very important issue related to the European Prize for Literature.
The prize is financed by the Cultural Programme of the European Union, and it aims to put the spotlight on creativity in the field of contemporary fiction.
I think it is a very good initiative, but I have my concerns about its implementation.
I have been contacted by cultural organisations from my country that are unhappy because Romania is not included this year in the programme.
Indeed, out of 34 eligible countries, only 12 are included each year in this programme.
The legitimate question is how the remaining countries, including Romania, could take an active part if they are not included at all in the programme.
So I would like to bring this problem to your attention, and I hope we will find, together with the European Commission, a convenient way to settle this problem.
