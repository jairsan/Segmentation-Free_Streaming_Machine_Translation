Mr President, first, let me say thanks to the Belgian Presidency because it is really trying, but they need to do a little bit more.
The European Parliament has shown a lot of goodwill in accepting the figures for 2011 because we understand the economic situation in the Member States.
Regarding commitments, it is even, in real terms, a reduction of the budget.
We have also offered solutions to a number of practical things like ITER institutions, like the financial supervisory authorities and the External Action Service; we have been constructive.
But we do not accept that the economic crisis will be here for ever and that the crisis should set the limits for the future of Europe.
We do not accept that single-minded austerity is the way out.
We do not accept that the crisis requires less Europe or an anti-European agenda.
More concretely, we have criticised the lack of flexibility in the European Union budget for years, and the Commission agrees with us.
So how can the solution to the budget problems suddenly be to restrict flexibility?
How can the future of Europe be to cut funding of mutually agreed priority programmes and not fund new ones – ITER is not the only priority – or even the most important ones.
Without reasonable flexibility, we risk building up a mountain of problems for 2012 and 2013.
Let us try to avoid that.
How can it be a problem to involve the European Parliament in a constructive dialogue on the future financial framework and the next long-term budget?
I do not understand.
Let us try again to find an agreement, but we must find a solution to flexibility that is not less ambitious than what we already have in the interinstitutional agreement.
We must find an open and constructive procedure on the next financial framework.
That is our red line.
Please, Council, try again.
