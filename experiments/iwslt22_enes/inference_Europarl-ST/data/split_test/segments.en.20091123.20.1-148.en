Madam President, I have the honour to present to Parliament the report of the Committee on International Trade on macro-financial assistance (MFA) to Bosnia and Herzegovina.
As with other countries to which the Commission has proposed to give MFA, the economy of Bosnia and Herzegovina has been seriously affected by the current economic and financial crisis.
Its economy is in a serious situation and it is clear that a way out of this crisis must be found.
Therefore, Bosnia and Herzegovina has applied for EU assistance and the Commission has proposed to provide it in the form of a loan amounting to up to EUR 100 million, which is to be made available in two instalments during 2010.
Now we have to decide whether we support this request or not.
Under the current treaty rules, we are merely consulted.
Therefore, on the one hand, one could argue: why not wait for the Treaty of Lisbon to enter into force and handle a modified proposal already under the ordinary legislative procedure?
On the other hand, despite the increasing importance of our work after the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, I believe that we, as a Parliament, must show responsibility and political commitment and do
our part in giving this Balkan country, early next year already, the assistance it needs now, rather than discussing it at length and being able to give the assistance only at some unknown point of time in the future.
For the above reasons, the suggestion of the Committee on International Trade is to have the proposal of MFA to Bosnia and Herzegovina adopted before the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon without amendments under the simplified procedure.
My colleagues on our committee supported this proposal unanimously and now I ask for the support of the whole House as well.
