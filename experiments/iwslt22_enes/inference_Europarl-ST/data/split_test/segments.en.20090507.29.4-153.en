Mr President, after 15 years this will be my last speech in the European Parliament and I think there are few more important issues than the whole question of asylum and how European countries face this challenge.
There is no easy response to this issue either.
If there was, some country would have found it by now.
In reality, I would suggest that the only way to reduce the number of desperate people who seek refuge or asylum in a country other than their own is to address the root causes that force them to leave their homes and countries of origin.
That is why it is so important that we in the EU, and in all developed democratic countries, offer advice, help and support – including financial support – to those countries that are affected by war, internal violence, lack of human rights or discrimination.
Equally, we have to address the poverty around the world which contributes to migratory pressures.
We should never condemn people who are forced to seek asylum or refugee status.
Instead, we should offer sympathy and offer our support.
That is our challenge today.
