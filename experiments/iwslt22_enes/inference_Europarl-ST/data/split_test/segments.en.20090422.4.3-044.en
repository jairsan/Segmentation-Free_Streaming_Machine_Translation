Madam President, I am glad that, in the end, common sense has prevailed in Parliament and the Commission concerning the causes of this financial crisis.
People have realised that this crisis is not of a cyclical nature and that a thorough overhaul of the regulation and supervision of financial markets is badly needed.
The de Larosi√®re group report and the Turner report, too, have made this quite clear.
These reports are in analytical tune with the Lamfalussy follow-up report of Parliament.
The documents which are being debated today are to be seen in the same logic of action.
Unfortunately, our economies will still suffer for quite a while, not least because of the public budgets and, probably, future inflationary facts of the efforts which are being undertaken to clean up the huge mess.
Let us hope that we will learn more this time than we have from previous episodes of crisis.
