Like the minister, I have no wish to make Europe into a fortress, and I want sensible security checks and to use new technology.
But I have witnessed the use of these passports, and I wonder if he can tell me where I am going wrong, because what happens is a person in possession of an electronic passport comes up to a machine, places his or her passport on the reader and then walks through if the passport is in order.
I cannot see how that is doing anything other than checking whether that person is in possession of a valid passport.
What it is not doing is checking that the person has one that has been issued in his or her name.
My understanding, therefore, is that there would be nothing to stop me using your passport, Minister – providing you were to lend it to me – to go through a check, because there is nobody there to see whether the picture and the person is the same, or I could be using the passport of a distinguished person like Mr McMillan-Scott.
I wonder if you can give me an assurance as to where the check is actually taking place concerning the ownership and the actual identity of the person.
