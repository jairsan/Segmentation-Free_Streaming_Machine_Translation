Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mr Parish on bringing this forward.
Despite our political differences, and notwithstanding his very obvious deficiencies as a human being, I think he is actually very sound on this and I support him.
We need this regulation to be a success and we need it to be universally in force, but I have a number of reservations and I disagree with some colleagues who spoke this morning.
Mr Stevenson said that longer journeys were unavoidable – I say: not so.
Mrs Jensen spoke of 24-hours transport – not necessarily.
Mr Allister, the agricultural industry has to ask questions itself.
As a civilised society, we need to look at the whole question, the whole purpose, the whole idea of transporting animals long distances and then killing them.
If I were a meat eater, I would be asking how can the suffering en route which we know about, the dehydration, the stress and – to our Irish colleagues North and South – the sea journeys, possibly improve the quality of the product at the end?
To my mind, it makes no economic sense.
It does not make humanitarian sense.
This is why I favour a complete ban on the transport of animals, which, I believe, would support rural economies.
It would encourage local producers, yes, small- and medium-sized enterprises as someone spoke of, and it would enable consumption of food as near the point of production as possible.
In the absence of that, and I know it is not going to happen in the near future, I think we need proper realistic enforcement of what we have at the moment, the regulation, and I urge the Commission to use all
the agencies across Europe – police forces on motorways if necessary – to stop and check lorries to see whether they are carrying out the full requirements of this legislation.
