Madam President, we also welcome the successful conclusion of the second phase of the EU open skies agreement.
Indeed, after several years it was rather overdue.
Obviously this agreement is a significant breakthrough and it is to be welcomed.
I acknowledge that negotiators have made huge progress in the areas of security, competition, market access and environmental cooperation.
But, like the Commissioner, I am disappointed that this agreement did not achieve its ultimate objective of a complete opening of the market without restrictions on either side.
The failure to resolve fully issues of foreign ownership and control (cabotage) must be addressed in future discussions if European carriers are to truly benefit.
Of course agreements mean compromise, but that does not mean getting a deal at any price.
The aviation industry is massively important to Europe.
It facilitates economic growth, trade, investment and tourism.
Air agreements with third countries offer our airlines great opportunities in foreign markets, and I therefore urge the Commission to continue to strive to conclude air agreements which are fair, robust and lead to full liberalisation, which will benefit both European carriers and consumers.
Finally, can we just add our support to the EU-Vietnam agreement.
