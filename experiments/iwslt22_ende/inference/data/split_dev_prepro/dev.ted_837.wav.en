several years ago here at ted peter skillman introduced a design challenge called the marshmallow challenge
and the idea's pretty simple teams of four have to build the tallest free-standing structure out of 20 sticks of spaghetti one yard of tape one yard of string and a marshmallow
the marshmallow has to be on top
and though it seems really simple it's actually pretty hard because it forces people to collaborate very quickly
and so i thought this was an interesting idea and i incorporated it into a design workshop
and it was a huge success
and since then i've conducted about 70 design workshops across the world with students and designers and architects even the ctos of the fortune 50 and there's something about this exercise that reveals very deep lessons about the nature of collaboration and i'd like to share some of them with you
so normally most people begin by orienting themselves to the task
they talk about it they figure out what it's going to look like they jockey for power
then they spend some time planning organizing they sketch and they lay out spaghetti
they spend the majority of their time assembling the sticks into ever-growing structures and then finally just as they're running out of time someone takes out the marshmallow and then they gingerly put it on top and then they stand back and ta-da
they admire their work
but what really happens most of the time is that the ta-da turns into an uh-oh because the weight of the marshmallow causes the entire structure to buckle and to collapse
so there are a number of people who have a lot more uh-oh moments than others and among the worst are recent graduates of business school laughter they lie they cheat they get distracted and they produce really lame structures
and of course there are teams that have a lot more ta-da structures and among the best are recent graduates of kindergarten laughter and it's pretty amazing
as peter tells us not only do they produce the tallest structures but they're the most interesting structures of them all
so the question you want to ask is how come why what is it about them
and peter likes to say that none of the kids spend any time trying to be ceo of spaghetti inc right they don't spend time jockeying for power
but there's another reason as well
and the reason is that business students are trained to find the single right plan right
and then they execute on it
and then what happens is when they put the marshmallow on the top they run out of time and what happens
it's a crisis sound familiar right what kindergarteners do differently is that they start with the marshmallow and they build prototypes successive prototypes always keeping the marshmallow on top so they have multiple times to fix when they build prototypes along the way
designers recognize this type of collaboration as the essence of the iterative process
and with each version kids get instant feedback about what works and what doesn't work
so the capacity to play in prototype is really essential but let's look at how different teams perform
so the average for most people is around 20 inches business schools students about half of that lawyers a little better but not much better than that kindergarteners better than most adults
who does the very best
architects and engineers thankfully laughter thirty-nine inches is the tallest structure i've seen and why is it because they understand triangles and self-reinforcing geometrical patterns are the key to building stable structures
so ceos a little bit better than average but here's where it gets interesting
if you put you put an executive admin. on the team they get significantly better laughter it's incredible
you know you look around you go oh that team's going to win you can just tell beforehand and why is that because they have special skills of facilitation
they manage the process they understand the process
and any team who manages and pays close attention to work will significantly improve the team's performance
specialized skills and facilitation skills are the combination that leads to strong success
if you have 10 teams that typically perform you'll get maybe six or so that have standing structures
and i tried something interesting
i thought let's up the ante once
so i offered a 10,000 dollar prize of software to the winning team
so what do you think happened to these design students
what was the result here's what happened not one team had a standing structure
if anyone had built say a one inch structure they would have taken home the prize
so isn't that interesting that high stakes have a strong impact
we did the exercise again with the same students
what do you think happened then
so now they understand the value of prototyping
so the same team went from being the very worst to being among the very best
they produced the tallest structures in the least amount of time
so there's deep lessons for us about the nature of incentives and success
so you might ask why would anyone actually spend time writing a marshmallow challenge
and the reason is i help create digital tools and processes to help teams build cars and video games and visual effects
and what the marshmallow challenge does is it helps them identify the hidden assumptions
because frankly every project has its own marshmallow doesn't it
the challenge provides a shared experience a common language a common stance to build the right prototype
and so this is the value of the experience of this so simple exercise
and those of you who are interested may want to go to marshmallowchallenge.com. it's a blog that you can look at how to build the marshmallows
there's step-by-step instructions on this
there are crazy examples from around the world of how people tweak and adjust the system
there's world records that are on this as well
and the fundamental lesson i believe is that design truly is a contact sport
it demands that we bring all of our senses to the task and that we apply the very best of our thinking our feeling and our doing to the challenge that we have at hand
and sometimes a little prototype of this experience is all that it takes to turn us from an uh-oh moment to a ta-da moment
and that can make a big difference
thank you very much
applause
