madam president i am going to put the question on behalf of my committee the committee on international trade and as the chair of this committee
the effects of the crisis on world trade indicate a possible 10 decline in 2009
this represents the biggest such contraction since the second world war brought on by the collapse in global demand
keeping international trade flowing is vital for the eu and other exports-oriented countries
despite commitments made by the g20 trade restrictive and distortive measures in response to the crisis have increased within the g20 as well as globally
the first sub-question is what steps have been taken by the commission to tackle such measures and conversely have any steps been taken by third countries against any other eu measures to boost economic growth
the second sub-question there are indicators that some of the emerging countries that have been less affected by the crisis are becoming drivers of growth in international trade
in this case eu industry needs to retarget its export markets and possibly the future of its products
what strategy does the commission intend to pursue to enable eu industry to become more competitive
third sub-question the global crisis and subsequent fall in world trade are having multiple effects on developing countries where the most unemployment is concentrated
what adjustment measures does the commission plan to take in its trade relations in particular for the poorest countries in the world
fourth point while on the one hand large trade deficits are driven by excessive spending and indebtedness in some member
states including the united states of america on the other hand large export-driven economies in certain emerging countries are experiencing trade surpluses
these trade deficits have contributed to global imbalances that are at the root of the global economic crisis
what strategy does the commission intend to pursue to mitigate such global imbalances in its trade policy
fifth and last point the social impact of the economic crisis and the subsequent fall in world trade are set to outlast economic recovery
for example we are seeing signs of economic recovery now but levels of unemployment remain very high
when does the commission plan to conduct an impact assessment on the impact of the crisis on jobs in europe and in the developing countries
what strategy does it intend to pursue to incorporate the social and environmental dimension of trade into international wto rules
these are the five points that the committee on international trade would like to address to the new trade commissioner
mr de gucht whom i welcome to the floor for the first public exchange of views with parliament and the members of the inta committee in particular
thank you in advance for the answers that i am sure you will be able to give to the questions that we are putting to you
