mr president i want to congratulate both our rapporteurs
a couple of years ago i was the rapporteur for access for disabled passengers to aeroplanes
this legislation is another piece in the jigsaw to make transport as inclusive as possible or as our colleague mr albertini put it to consolidate passenger rights
in an age when we are encouraging people to travel by public transport it is so important that we add coaches and buses as mr albertini has to this field
some members not necessarily those here today have looked for ways to make exemptions to exclude certain sections but i have always taken as my starting point the desire to include as much as possible in this so we move towards making europe more of a common market for people
that is why amendment 81 is so important
the commissioner in his remarks said we need the same rights for all passengers with no exceptions and then he spoke about the exceptions for example for regional transport
i do not think we should exempt regional transport and i have done some research
in some of our member states a regional coach journey can take up to six hours which is longer than an international coach journey from say london to brussels or paris
so i think it should be included
i think it is right that where local transport as mr jarzembowski has referred to is not included there are public service contracts which mean that the companies will reach the same sort of standards
i also think we need to persuade the construction industry to build more modern buses with the needs of disabled people more in mind
just as we have campaigned for aeroplanes to be more accessible to disabled people so we need perhaps coaches with wider gangways or more accessible toilets and we need the operating companies to make their coach terminals more accessible and to train their staff in disability and disability awareness issues
this is a good report
it is a good collection of reports which takes us several steps forward and i congratulate everyone who has been involved
