mr president during the last few months the eu has experienced several changes and transitions
we have had three commissioners on international trade two eu council presidents and the lisbon treaty
during that time i argued with all the top officials about the need to fine-tune the south korea-eu fta so as to get on board deeply dissatisfied industries particularly the eu automotive industry
the strongest arguments were mainly in the area of ddb safeguards and non-tariff barriers
when the new commissioner in response to my question during the hearings stated that ddb deserved a closer look i felt optimistic
even the usa has shelved its fta with south korea partly because of similar objections from the car industry
this is the first major fta
this is a template
we need to do it right
there must be a level playing field for both parties
please do not get me wrong
i am a strong proponent of ftas
i understand their positive impact on gdp and employment but we should also understand that when the competitive advantage is one-sided benefits will diminish and in the worst case could even be negative
employees in the eu deserve better
perhaps we should turn to our transatlantic partner and together demand small adjustments which would at least partially satisfy these giant industries and get new ftas to work as soon as possible
there will always be some unsatisfied elements but all in all ftas must be beneficial to citizens of both sides
it is my responsibility to monitor the situation and ensure that my constituents and eu citizens get a fair deal
