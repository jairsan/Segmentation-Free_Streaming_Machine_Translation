Madam President, I am going to put the question on behalf of my committee, the Committee on International Trade, and as the chair of this committee.
The effects of the crisis on world trade indicate a possible 10% decline in 2009.
This represents the biggest such contraction since the Second World War brought on by the collapse in global demand.
Keeping international trade flowing is vital for the EU and other exports-oriented countries.
Despite commitments made by the G20, trade restrictive and distortive measures in response to the crisis have increased within the G20, as well as globally.
The first sub-question is: what steps have been taken by the Commission to tackle such measures and, conversely, have any steps been taken by third countries against any other EU measures to boost economic growth?
The second sub-question: there are indicators that some of the emerging countries that have been less affected by the crisis are becoming drivers of growth in international trade.
In this case, EU industry needs to retarget its export markets and possibly the future of its products.
What strategy does the Commission intend to pursue to enable EU industry to become more competitive?
Third sub-question: the global crisis and subsequent fall in world trade are having multiple effects on developing countries where the most unemployment is concentrated.
What adjustment measures does the Commission plan to take in its trade relations in particular for the poorest countries in the world?
Fourth point: while, on the one hand, large trade deficits are driven by excessive spending and indebtedness in some Member
States, including the United States of America, on the other hand, large export-driven economies in certain emerging countries are experiencing trade surpluses.
These trade deficits have contributed to global imbalances that are at the root of the global economic crisis.
What strategy does the Commission intend to pursue to mitigate such global imbalances in its trade policy?
Fifth and last point: the social impact of the economic crisis and the subsequent fall in world trade are set to outlast economic recovery.
For example, we are seeing signs of economic recovery now, but levels of unemployment remain very high.
When does the Commission plan to conduct an impact assessment on the impact of the crisis on jobs in Europe and in the developing countries?
What strategy does it intend to pursue to incorporate the social and environmental dimension of trade into international WTO rules?
These are the five points that the Committee on International Trade would like to address to the new Trade Commissioner
Mr De Gucht, whom I welcome to the floor for the first public exchange of views with Parliament and the members of the INTA Committee, in particular.
Thank you in advance for the answers that I am sure you will be able to give to the questions that we are putting to you.
