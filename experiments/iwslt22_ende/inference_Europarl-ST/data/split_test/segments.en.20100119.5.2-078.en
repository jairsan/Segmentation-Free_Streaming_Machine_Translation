Mr President, I think it is clear to all of us here that the Iranian regime is a dictatorial and criminal regime.
The question is: how to deal with it?
I would like to state very clearly my support for the delegation that would have gone to Iran from this Parliament.
The delegation would have met, for one whole day, members of the opposition and dissidents.
It would have strengthened them.
They wanted that.
So I really feel very sorry that this delegation visit could not take place.
I have one very concrete question to you, Baroness Ashton.
Several Members here have talked about sanctions.
From the experience I have as a member of the national parliament and talking with many people for a long time, I would really be in favour of smart sanctions – targeted, for example, at specific members of the Revolutionary Guard, putting them on a veto list for visits, or at other specific persons.
I am very much against imposing sanctions on the whole country as that would probably strengthen the government, because then poverty would increase – they would not have access, for example, to petrol – and that would help to support the regime instead of weakening it.
