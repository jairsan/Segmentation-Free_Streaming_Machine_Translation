Madam President, I agree with those speakers who said we have a real opportunity in front of us with a new US Administration in place.
Three quick points.
Firstly, we seem to have evolved into a situation where we have a huge number of subjects which are discussed between the EU and the US, but no strategic dialogue, and yet they tell me in Washington that the US and China have a much greater strategic dialogue than between us across the Atlantic.
Is it not time at this summit to say that we want a strategic dialogue for a strategic partnership?
Secondly, regarding the point on protectionism on the TEC, it is quite clear that the biggest danger in the next 12 months is closing markets rather than opening ones, and yet we have the transatlantic market which is, as Mr Brok said, the biggest opportunity we have for generating growth on both sides of the Atlantic.
Is it not time to make the transatlantic market a major part of trade development, rather than putting it to one side as a regulatory issue?
It is actually a major opener. Lastly, it is disappointing that we have no study and no road map as promised by Mr Verheugen.
The study was paid for by Parliament.
If you want Parliament to cooperate on saying how we now need to see how to open markets, please release this report, as the resolution says, by 15 November.
