Mr President, the Horn of Africa is a dreadful region where internal and regional conflicts continue to undermine peace and security.
They create humanitarian disasters and paralyse the development of this strategically significant region.
Each war, each conflict accentuates the fragility of the states.
At the heart of most of these conflicts is the lack of leadership and democratic governments rightly put forward in the report of the EP delegation.
What this region needs is home-grown democratisation, respect for national and international rule of law and above all national reconciliation.
About Somalia, I would like to emphasise that the resignation of former president Yusuf and the withdrawal of Ethiopian forces creates a huge window of opportunity.
The time has come to pick up the pieces and bring about intra-Somali peace.
The Somali Parliament is a crucial factor for confidence-building and can make the peace process all-inclusive.
Furthermore, it is imperative that the EU supports the renewal and strengthening of an African Union Peace Force.
This force needs a decent UN mandate.
If not, Ugandan and Burundian forces will pull away from Mogadishu leaving a security gap behind.
I entirely agree with Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner.
There is a momentum for change now in Somalia that should be taken advantage of.
The power as well as the security vacuum must be filled.
If not, the stateless chaos known as Somalia will remain.
