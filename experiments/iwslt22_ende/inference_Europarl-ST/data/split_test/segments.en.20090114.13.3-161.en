Mr President, today we have just voted on the situation of fundamental rights in the European Union.
It is with great regret that, together with my two Maltese colleagues in the PSE Group, we have had to abstain from voting on the report.
Although the report refers to numerous issues of fundamental human rights which are laudable, it includes other issues, such as abortion, which should never have been included in this report.
As the Maltese social representatives in the European Parliament are against abortion, we have had to vote against these particular parts of the report.
There are, indeed, other issues included in this report, such as living wills and the right to dignity at the end of life, which are sensitive issues, regarding which we have had to abstain.
That is why we abstained at the end of this vote.
I would like to thank you for this opportunity.
