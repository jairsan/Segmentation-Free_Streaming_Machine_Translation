Madam President, Europe has a turbulent history with regard to totalitarianism and the restriction of basic freedoms.
In some parts of Europe the 20th century was hallmarked by such totalitarian regimes.
It is our moral obligation today to make sure that every citizen of the European Union enjoys the same rights.
It is highly important that the EU should also support the rights of minorities, especially since many countries all around the world do not respect very basic rights in this sense.
At the same time I would like to point out that, while the EU speaks out against discrimination and violation of human rights in cases like Tibet, it is clear to all of us that even within the European Union there are ethnic and linguistic minorities which are very often targets of cultural and linguistic assimilation.
This practice of some nation states in the EU is an aspect that should be seriously reviewed and reconsidered.
The Hungarians in Romania, the people I represent, are such a case.
