Sometimes a question flies away, and this is perhaps a bit obsolete, I must admit, but I thank the Commission for giving such a fair answer.
My appeal, and my worry, is that we are over-reacting, and I hope the Commission could consider that.
I agree that we should act and react, but we should not overdo it, because we need a balanced approach.
Otherwise – and I think that is something we should consider in the long term – we could harm growth in Europe.
So, I think, a balanced approach; and I rely on the Commission to ensure these measures are implemented in an appropriate way.
