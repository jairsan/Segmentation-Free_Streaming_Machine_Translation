Madam President, ever since I had the honour of drafting the report on combating HIV / AIDS within the EU and neighbouring countries, I have been very committed to this issue, with all its implications and ramifications, of people living with HIV.
One year ago, in the framework of the conference ‘ HIV in Europe 2007 ’, participants developed a comprehensive call to action on measures regarding how to effectively tackle HIV / AIDS in Europe.
Some elements of this call are now also reflected in this joint motion for a resolution.
The aim of this resolution is to contribute to the fight against HIV / AIDS on a political level.
Therefore, it calls on the Council and the Commission to formulate a comprehensive strategy on HIV to promote early diagnosis, ensure early care and communicate the benefits of earlier care to all European citizens.
It calls on the Commission to commit substantial resources to deliver the above-mentioned strategy and asks Member States to step up information and education campaigns on prevention, testing and treatment.
I am aware that the Commission is planning to bring forward a new communication on combating HIV in the EU and the neighbourhood and also that Commissioner Vassiliou confirmed her personal commitment to take further action in this field.
To conclude, this situation needs to be urgently tackled.
