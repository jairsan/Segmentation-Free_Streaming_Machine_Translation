Mr President, here in the European Parliament, we recently adopted a resolution on Ukraine in which we questioned the granting
by the former President of Ukraine of a high state award to Stepan Bandera, a leader of the struggle for the country ’ s independence.
This paragraph in our resolution has attracted much criticism in western Ukraine.
I would like to say that this resolution did not question Bandera ’ s goal of an independent Ukraine.
Indeed, the resolution supported the cause of a strong, united and free Ukraine, which has the full backing of the European Union and my native Poland, but
the resolution did suggest regret that the award was given with little regard to the tragic circumstances of the wartime struggle for an independent Ukraine.
This saw ethnic cleansing carried out also in the name of Bandera.
My view is that what was missing from the award given to Bandera was an expression of regret for innocent victims of the struggle.
Only then could it have fully served the goal of an independent Ukraine in peace with its neighbours.
The award should have been accompanied by an effort for reconciliation with the families.
