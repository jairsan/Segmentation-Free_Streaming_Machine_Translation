Mr President, I rise on Mr Hoppenstedt ’ s report to give the Budget Committee ’ s opinion.
Like Mr Hoppenstedt, this will be my last speech before this Chamber after 20 years.
The Budget Committee recognises the importance of these proposals and their urgency.
It is quite clear that some key EU policies will be undermined without proper financing and therefore we are happy to support the proposal.
However, we would point that this money is coming from the margin of heading 1a, so that will reduce the margin and therefore reduce the availability of funding for other projects which may be important in the future.
We should bear that in mind.
Secondly, we should also ensure that these organisations do not in any way become agencies because, if they did, they would of course be subject to the interinstitutional agreement on agencies.
Finally, we would not want the Budget Committee ’ s position to be in any way undermined by the rush for these proposals.
That is why the Budget Committee was happy to support Mr McCreevy ’ s proposal on Monday night about interim funding, so that we can ensure that proper financial procedures and a proper trialogue takes place on the financial implication of these proposals.
