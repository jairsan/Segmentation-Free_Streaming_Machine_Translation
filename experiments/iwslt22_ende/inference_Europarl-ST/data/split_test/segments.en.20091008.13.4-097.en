Madam President, I voted for the resolution.
I am glad to see that both Europe and the most powerful countries do not underestimate the seriousness of the situation we are all in and are not looking for a ‘ one size fits all ’ approach.
The crisis has been caused by a number of complex and interrelated factors, and there will be no easy way out.
The global financial crisis also gave us a good opportunity to reconsider our priorities and actions, especially in the long-term management of sustainable economic recovery.
We have commitments to and expectations from our citizens to get our economies moving again at full speed with a view to ensuring the effective functioning of capital markets and lending, tackling unemployment and creating jobs, and protecting our people, especially the poorest and most vulnerable.
This is not going to be easy, but I believe that we are moving in the right direction.
