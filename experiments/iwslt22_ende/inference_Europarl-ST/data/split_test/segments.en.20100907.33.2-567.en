Madam President, it is absolutely vital that our voters are well informed on current affairs.
Information encourages citizens ’ interest in public matters and their participation.
We, as politicians, need a level playing field if our various messages are to get a fair public hearing.
Unfortunately today, the commercial media are increasingly choosing only to entertain our voters.
As a result, they have limited their coverage of current affairs.
Thus, it falls to our public media to do more and more in the field of information and education.
Dangerously, there are some parties and politicians who continue to try to gain control over the public media.
This is happening in many Member States – Italy, Hungary, Romania and France, to name just a few.
We must resist this trend.
Since 1989, the Council of Europe, which has already been mentioned in our debate, has played a magnificent role in setting standards for free and unbiased public media in Europe.
These Council of Europe standards must be enforced in all Member States, both in the former Communist East and in Western Europe.
We as a parliament should work more closely with our neighbours here in Strasbourg on this issue.
Our Member State governments are responsible for ensuring that public media retain their independence and their ability to
provide unbiased information, and we, the European Parliament, should continue to monitor how well they fulfil this public duty.
