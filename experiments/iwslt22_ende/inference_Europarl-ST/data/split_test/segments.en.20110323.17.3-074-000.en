Madam President, I regret to say that it seems that this European Council could bring on some dangerous changes, and we should be concerned about this.
Under the banner of so-called economic coordination, economic governance, stability for the euro area, we see a favouring of EU-wide tax harmonisation and EU-wide fiscal unification.
Parliament, unfortunately, has been playing a very active role in that.
Let me speak clearly. The Commission ’ s proposal of a Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base is a risky step that will undermine healthy tax competition amongst Member States, prove harmful to the economy and drive business away from those who impose the policy.
This has all gone too far and must be stopped.
What we have also seen in the last few days is an attempt by some Member States to interfere in the fiscal and tax sovereignty of others.
You know what I am referring to: the very disgraceful bullying of Ireland.
We must not let this happen again.
Turning to Libya, developments in Libya have reminded us once again that we should not expect too much from the so-called EU Common Foreign and Security Policy.
National leaders, not EU leaders, have shown international leadership.
Prime Minister Cameron and President Sarkozy have made and pushed through decisions – not the EU representatives.
I think that it shows clearly that there are limits to integration in this field – but not only in this field.
No Member State should feel obliged to do more than it feels is right.
This is as valid for foreign policy as it is for economic policy.
Europe must stay flexible wherever possible and not be driven by rigid integrationist dogma any more, and it is time for a change in the EU integration paradigm.
That is clear.
That is understandable, and I hope that the European Council will deal with that.
