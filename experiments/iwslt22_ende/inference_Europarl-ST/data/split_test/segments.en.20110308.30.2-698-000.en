Madam President, I would like to congratulate Mr Lange on an excellent report, and a substantive one, to make us think about the trends for industrial policy.
As we come out of the biggest recession for the last 60 years, we really have to galvanise our industries to be competitive in global markets – backing small firms, boosting enterprise, and supporting all those who want to create jobs.
So the linkage between innovation skills and sustainability is evident.
Not necessarily by using funds – we can do this by strengthening the internal market, trade promotion and providing a supportive framework for innovation.
Lastly, one element missing for me is the digital agenda.
Everyone in Europe, every business, should have the right to have access to the best IT, mobile and broadband at super speeds.
Were you aware, Commissioner, that South Korea fixed the aim last week to have, by the end of next year, Internet speeds plugged into every home that will be 200 times faster than those in the average household in the US?
As was said by one senior IT executive, for Europe ’ s competitiveness, one has to realise that it is much better enhanced by investing in IT compared to physical infrastructure.
