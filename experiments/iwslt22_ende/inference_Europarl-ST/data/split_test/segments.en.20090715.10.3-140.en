Mr President, as the situation in Iran escalates and the violation of democracy also presents a danger to the stability of the whole region, we have to express our concern and condemnation – but declarations must not only be symbolic and empty.
Some European leaders are talking about new sanctions to be imposed on Iran, but a discussion is needed right now on the promotion of democracy at grass-root level in this country.
I am Polish, and we in Eastern Europe know how important these types of actions are for the establishment of democracy.
A promotion should be adapted to the political and economic situation in a given country, but previous EU experience in the promotion of democracy in North Africa, the Middle East and Eastern Europe
has to be reviewed and evaluated in order to see what should be done in Iran, what can be done in Iran and what is effective under given circumstances in this country.
I also want to remind you that, if the EU wants to be credible, it also has to undertake some measures in Moldova.
Soon we will face a new test – on 29 July – with the elections in Moldova.
The EU has to do everything it can to ensure free and fair democratic elections in this country.
It is not enough to talk about support for democracy: we in the European Parliament and European institutions have to be more active in that respect.
