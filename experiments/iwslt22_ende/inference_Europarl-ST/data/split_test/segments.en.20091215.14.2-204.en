Mr President, I think that the recent European Union position led by the Swedish Presidency on the Middle East that would recognise East
Jerusalem as the capital of a future independent Palestinian state may harm European efforts to play a significant part in mediating between Israel and the Palestinians.
It might be counterproductive with our common objective to bring peace to this already turbulent region.
I personally believe that rather than unilaterally and unexpectedly announcing an independent capital for the Palestinian territories, it would be preferable and more useful
if the European Union would concentrate all its efforts on encouraging and pushing for the creation of a real democracy in the Palestinian territories, for example, supporting non-violent opposition.
This would help the Israeli state and democracy, as well as the international community, to find a credible and legitimate interlocutor.
As Cecilia Malmström has said today, the status of Jerusalem should be negotiated bilaterally by Israelis and Palestinians.
I therefore believe that rather than a ‘ two states for two peoples ’ solution, a ‘ two democracies for two peoples ’ vision would be more desirable.
Democracy, dear colleagues, is a precondition for peace.
