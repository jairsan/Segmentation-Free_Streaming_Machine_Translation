Mr President, the Goldstone report tries to fulfil the mandate it was given.
That mandate is, or was, the following: ‘ To investigate all violations of international human rights law and international humanitarian law that might have been committed at any time in the
context of the military operations that were conducted in Gaza during the period from 27 December 2008 and 18 January 2009, whether before, during or after.
’ And that is exactly what the Goldstone report has done – although it was not just Mr Goldstone, it was also his two female colleagues.
They conducted investigations on what happened in Gaza and came up with conclusions that are disturbing to say the least.
They are extremely disturbing because they find in most of the instances they looked into that breaches of international law and international humanitarian law
and breaches of the Geneva Conventions have indeed been committed by the forces of a state that claims to be the sole democratic state in the region.
That is indeed very disquieting.
We should not let it pass.
So when we are called upon to take a position on this report, the question is not whether we are for or against Israel, for or against the Palestinians, for or against Hamas; the
question is whether we condone breaches of international law, of international humanitarian law and of the Geneva Conventions, no matter by whom they were committed.
That is what we need to answer.
