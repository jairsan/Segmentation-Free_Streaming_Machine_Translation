Mr President, I would like to remind the House of the double standards which we are applying.
In the case of the Hungarian media law, an event which took place on Monday was not reflected in our resolution.
Now we are trying to include something which happened only yesterday.
This is a clear double standard which this House is applying, which is deplorable and unacceptable.
