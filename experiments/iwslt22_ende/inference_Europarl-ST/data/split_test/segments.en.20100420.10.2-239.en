Mr President, last week ’ s riots have led Kyrgyzstan into a political, judicial and economic crisis.
Its constitutional court was practically disbanded and the interim government ’ s actions appear uncoordinated.
Meanwhile, the brother of Kurmanbek Bakiyev has announced that the hand-written resignation statement is a fake and that Bakiyev did not himself resign.
According to eye-witnesses, new local groups trying to take over regional governments have emerged.
Similarly, ethnic-based groupings appear, creating fear of more ethnic violence.
Criminal groups operate freely in the country.
Large numbers of weapons are being circulated and robberies are taking place.
Safety, security and the interests of the EU citizens in this country are still endangered.
The present interim government is unable to counter any of these threats.
The situation is completely unclear for the local people.
High Representative Ashton has issued two statements expressing her concern, but more active and practical actions are urgently needed instead.
It is important that the EU take a decisive position on the situation in Kyrgyzstan in this strategically important country.
We need to be more present there, cooperating with the UN, USA and OSCE to defend the interests of Kyrgyzstani and EU citizens who are currently unable to protect their lives and defend their property.
It is clear that the EU should pursue an independent investigation into the causes and effects of the riots.
About the material resources of the Kyrgyz Bank and the agency for investment and development: they need to be evaluated before assigning any further financial assistance.
Inactivity and hesitancy on the EU ’ s part and an absence of real strategy and tactics may lead to very dangerous developments and undermine the EU ’ s own economic and political interests and credibility in the region and in the rest of the world.
