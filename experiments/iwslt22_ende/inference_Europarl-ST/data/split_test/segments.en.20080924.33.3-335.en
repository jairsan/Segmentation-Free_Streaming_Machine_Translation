Commissioner, I would like to ask you once more about our famous Ignalina atomic plant.
Recently our Prime Minister met the President of the European Commission, Mr Barroso, and in our papers there were some interpretations that there is a gap; there is a possibility of prolonging the work of this station.
What is your opinion, and what would you recommend to the Lithuanian Government in this situation?
