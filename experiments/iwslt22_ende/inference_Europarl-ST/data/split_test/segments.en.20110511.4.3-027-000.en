Madam President, I should like to make this point to the Vice-President of the Commission / High Representative: Europe ’ s foreign policy currently lacks leadership, boldness and Community method, and this at a time when the Union has more foreign policy instruments at its disposal than ever.
You, as you often say yourself, are in listening mode: listening to national governments and waiting until they have pronounced themselves.
Then you present the lowest common denominator, and often at times when events have already moved on On Syria, for example, what are you convinced of?
Should Assad be included or not?
What is your opinion?
We would like to hear that.
Do you want to threaten sanctions or not?
You ask us, you did that in your reply, to put pressure on governments, so tell us which ones.
Open the debate.
Sure, Member States often lack the political will to act in a unified and decisive way, and they do not want to see you strong, but believe me, Baroness Ashton, they will not support you and will not save your life as High Representative.
They are not a guarantee for you to stay in your job, I promise you.
And also this does not change the fact that the Lisbon Treaty envisaged a stronger role for you.
You are the rotating Presidency.
You are Vice-President of the Commission.
You can take initiatives.
You should set the agenda.
You should set out in front your opinions, your decisions, and then let Member States react.
If you do not take initiatives, at least do not kill those of others.
For example, the review of the Göteborg Programme on Conflict Prevention: ten years ago, it was initiated by Anna Lindh.
The Hungarian Presidency started a review and wanted you to take it over, but you stopped it.
I do not understand why.
I can only recommend you dare more, delegate more.
Follow Margaret Mead, whom you cited.
Be the agent of change that we need.
I promise you: only this will save your position, and nothing else.
