Mr President, the majority of Europeans are not corporate leaders and not bankers but family farmers, small entrepreneurs, state employees.
The majority of Europe is completely fed up with the present system, in which global multinational corporations and banks rule the world.
They need, and they want, a fundamentally new paradigm, in which there must be a shift from globalisation to localisation, from completely profit- and
money-centred decision making to human-centred and community-centred decision making, from WTO-ruled free trade agriculture to food sovereignty, local production and local farming.
Please do not fail to represent at the G20 Summit the views of the majority of Europe.
