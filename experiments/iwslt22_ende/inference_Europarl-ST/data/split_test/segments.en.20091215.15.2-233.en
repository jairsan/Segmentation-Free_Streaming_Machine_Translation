Mr President, before the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, the three proposals in question were based on Articles 60, 301 and 308 of the Treaty establishing the European Community.
This is now only of historical interest, since the legal basis has changed and we have to refer to Articles 215 and 75 of the new treaty.
Incredible as it might seem, the Lisbon Treaty limited the role of the European Parliament in this particular case.
Article 215 clearly states that the Council only has to inform the European Parliament on the measures adopted, as opposed to the former procedure that implied the consultation of Parliament on such matters.
I cannot accept that, and I strongly support my colleagues ’ initiative to clarify Parliament ’ s involvement in this area.
Leaving aside the legal aspect that I hope will be solved through good cooperation between the European institutions, I would like to draw your attention to the important
problem that we are debating here, which is fighting terrorism and terrorism-related activities, such as the ones carried out by Osama bin Laden and the al-Qaeda network.
I think that when it comes to such sensitive topics, we cannot afford to classify them into strict categories such as EU-internal and
EU-external issues, because terrorist actions might be planned outside the EU but can seriously affect the people living inside the EU.
We have the responsibility to protect these European citizens against terrorist action, so we have to be given the tools to do that.
I trust your good judgment in solving this procedural problem, and I am looking forward to hearing the opinion of the representatives of the Council and the Commission.
