Mr President, is the Council aware of the fact that in the past years, SWIFT has never once transmitted specific data because it cannot extract it, and always transfers bulk data?
Is the Council aware of the fact that, precisely because of that, there is an agreement between the US and SWIFT that stations SWIFT personnel in the Treasury Department in order to ensure that the bulk data the Treasury gets does not get searched in a bulk manner?
Is the Council aware of the fact that the interim agreement does not include even the slightest concession to Parliament?
If I am right – which I hope I am – are the Council and the Commission committed to taking the bulk data issue extremely seriously in the mandate of the negotiations?
