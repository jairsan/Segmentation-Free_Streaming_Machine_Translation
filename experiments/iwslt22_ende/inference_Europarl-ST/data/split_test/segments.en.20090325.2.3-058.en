Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking the Czech Presidency for the successful summit.
I think the summit has come up with a number of important decisions, but at the same time I am of the opinion that we need more, and we need to move faster.
When we go to the G20 meeting in London in a week ’ s time, I have the impression that we are still too integrated to act alone and too divided to act together.
I see three main priorities that we should focus on.
The first, of course, is jobs.
Millions of people in Europe are afraid of losing their jobs and, frankly, I do not understand the position of the French President in opposing the summit: a fully fledged summit is something we need at this moment.
Second, I am happy that we managed to eliminate – partly, at least – protectionist tendencies.
Nevertheless, they are still alive, and I think solidarity is the key.
The third point: the key is to restore confidence in the markets.
I am not even of the opinion that there is too little money in the market; I think there is enough money.
The problem is to transform this money into effective demand, and for that to happen we need to restore confidence among households and enterprises.
