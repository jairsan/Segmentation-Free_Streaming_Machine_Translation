Madam President, I ask my colleagues to vote against the postponement.
We must speak out before the elections, so it must be now.
It is an issue about fair elections in a European country and that cannot be a partisan issue.
Last time in 2004 we could only speak out after the falsified elections and we were united.
This time there is ample evidence beforehand of security service interference and a massive practice of non-admittance or of fake local party lists to confuse voters.
So let us be united again for the sake of democracy.
I think the massive lobbying of the Ukrainian Embassies throughout Europe towards us to prevent this resolution is proof of how right we are to speak out now.
