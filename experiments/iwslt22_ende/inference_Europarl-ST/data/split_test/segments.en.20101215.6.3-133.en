Madam President, first I want to congratulate Zita Gurmai and Alain Lamassoure for this report.
I strongly welcome the citizens â€™ initiative mechanism.
It is a very positive grassroots initiative.
It will serve to greatly reduce the democratic deficit between the people and the European Union institutions.
Notably, it gives citizens a platform to express and propose ideas for European legislation.
The need for a minimum of one fourth of all Member States to collect signatures for the initiative ensures that the initiative will represent the need for a legislative proposal by a cross-section of society.
Finally, I would like to stress that it is important to have full transparency regarding the founding of the initiative and sources of financial support for the organisers.
