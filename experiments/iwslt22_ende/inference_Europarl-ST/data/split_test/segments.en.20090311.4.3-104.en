Madam President, on Monday evening, the Committee on Foreign Affairs adopted a motion regarding the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Sri Lanka, pursuant to Rule 91.
The situation in Sri Lanka is clearly very serious, but exactly what is happening regarding the humanitarian situation is far from clear.
I am conscious that there are many differing views across this House.
So I suggest that the most sensible course of action would be to timetable a proper debate, which cannot seriously be fitted in in this part-session but could be in our next part-session, which is just 10 days away.
I am grateful to Mr Daul of the PPE-DE Group for indicating his group â€™ s support for this course of action.
As we are a serious Chamber, I suggest and ask colleagues to support a debate with resolution and full participation at the next part-session, to do justice to the gravity of the situation in Sri Lanka.
