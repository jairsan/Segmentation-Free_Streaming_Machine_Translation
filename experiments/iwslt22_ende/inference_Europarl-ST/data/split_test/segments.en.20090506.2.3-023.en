Madam President, this is a sad day for the credibility of the European Union.
The economic recovery package we will vote on is, in reality, a non-recovery plan which will produce almost no immediate economic stimulus.
We have had months of sometimes intense negotiations with the EU Council.
Unfortunately, rather than standing up to those governments like Germany, the Netherlands and the UK, which adopted a short-sighted ‘ I want my money back ’ approach, the majority of this House and the Commission have simply caved in to their demands.
This outcome is very bad and it could have been avoided.
We could have built a real solidarity instrument, where the vast majority of the funds would have gone to those economies most in need: our friends in eastern Europe.
We could have enhanced the economic effectiveness of this package by using innovative finance instruments, like loan guarantee funds and the public banks, or the European Investment Bank.
This would have transformed the EUR 5 billion into EUR 50-80 billion in investment, which we need at this moment for the European economy.
We could have focused our investments on those areas with immediate job creation, such as cities in Europe investigating in
the renovation of buildings and public transport, or independent power companies investing in renewables, or our industries in Europe investing in eco-technologies.
Instead, you have decided to concentrate the bulk of these EUR 5 billion on old-fashioned state aid to those least in need of cash: the big energy oligopolies in the UK, Germany and France.
Instead of sending a strong signal, we are sending a signal of a lack of political courage: spineless European institutions that have caved in to the whims of nationally blinkered governments.
Unfortunately, we have no brave and visionary Commission President.
Unfortunately, the Liberals and the Socialists in this House were not ready to fight with the Greens to make this recovery package a real first step to a green new deal.
Before change can happen in Europe we must change the President of the Commission.
In order to make this change happen, we need to change the majorities in the European Parliament.
‘ Stop Barroso – go for a green new deal ’: this is more than ever the right slogan for the upcoming European elections.
