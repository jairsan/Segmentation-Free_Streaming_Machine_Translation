madam president i hope my colleague michael cashman and our colleagues will regard my remarks as a supplement and as a token of appreciation rather than a revision
the mdgs allow us a unique point of entry into the human condition at the beginning of the 21st century
therefore it is critically important to come up with a new and fresh perspective instead of offering that of the 20th century
it is a fact of our time that no development is possible without security and
this is why we have tried to offer a more balanced approach to the mdgs paying more attention to such regions as central asia where poverty goes hand in hand with a lack of safety insecurity instability forced child labour and even slavery
in addition to the autocratic regimes in uzbekistan and turkmenistan ethnic violence recently broke out in kyrgyzstan
dire straits combined with instability and violence may lead to a humanitarian catastrophe in the region
if we need proof that no durable and sustainable development exists without security we have it here
in addition to that we cannot forget about extreme forms of poverty in such european countries as moldova and albania
let us take for example some grave problems relating to health care
in ukraine and moldova 300 out of 10 000 people suffer from tuberculosis
the aforementioned countries do not fall into the category of least developed countries but they certainly fall into that of developing countries
if the mdgs do not embrace the least stable and least secure countries we will never achieve a viable social and moral order there
therefore the time has come to expand our horizons
although sub-saharan africa is crucial to us we cannot confine the mdgs to this sole familiar context
we are facing new challenges and we have to react to them
last but not least the mdgs are inseparable from the necessity to empower the least developed developing and least secure countries so that they can shape their future themselves
