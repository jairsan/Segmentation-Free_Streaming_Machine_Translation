Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mr Skinner on this report.
He has done an excellent job.
It has been a huge undertaking but he has really delivered on this very complex piece of legislation.
I would also like to congratulate the European institutions and Member States, who have brought us this successful conclusion of Solvency II.
It is a good example of how Europe must work together towards financial recovery.
Burdens will be shared, as will solutions.
This European approved response is a good example of a closer relationship on financial cooperation.
We have to work to make sure that there is never again a banking crisis like the one we are going through at the moment.
I did notice with great interest the Commission â€™ s approval of a mortgage support scheme for UK homeowners.
This scheme will allow householders who are unable to meet their mortgage repayments to defer all their principal and up to 70% of their interest payments for a period of two years.
We should carefully follow the progress of this scheme and learn from and implement any effective measures that would ease the burden we carry.
I think this is something that all Member States can look at, but I also think that financial institutions in Member States themselves could make it easier for people to move to interest-only mortgages if they found themselves in difficulty.
The financial institutions, considering the support that they have from Member State governments, could do a lot to help people who are under stress because of the recession.
