Mr President, I rise yet again to complain about the time management of this Parliament.
Both yesterday and today, we were given a time to vote, and we have abused it yet again.
Surely, the sign of a well run and effective Parliament is one that can manage its affairs properly and to time.
Can you please urge the authorities to get a grip of this?
Otherwise, we will be treated with the contempt we deserve.
