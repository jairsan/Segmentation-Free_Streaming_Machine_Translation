Mr President, over the years Europe and the rest of the world have fought to battle discrimination on all levels.
Our progression as decent humans demands that we do just that, respecting perfectly the subsidiarity principle.
As Mrs Buitenweg has stated, the Commission has promised, for over four years now, to pass a broad and inclusive proposal on the human rights of all people.
This is now coming, finally, to fruition.
I strongly believe that no person should ever be discriminated against on the basis of his or her religion or belief, disability or age.
On the contrary, as a Christian believer I call upon the European Parliament and each individual to not only stop discrimination but to help those who are being discriminated against because of their disability.
This help can come from us in different shapes and forms.
Each Member State has constantly persisted in improving equal access to those who need it the most.
As Europe continues to integrate, it is paramount that we remember that we are all different yet perfectly equal in all regards.
