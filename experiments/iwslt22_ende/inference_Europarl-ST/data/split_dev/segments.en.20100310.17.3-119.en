Mr President, colleagues have introduced an amendment which we could agree with if we combine it with the original amendment.
I understand the colleagues and we share the view that our strategic decision should not depend on Russia, but, on the other hand, Russia is an important partner.
If the colleagues could agree that we take their amendment and say ‘ including Russia ’ – Russia is one of the members of the continental dialogue – we could agree and we could vote for this amendment.
