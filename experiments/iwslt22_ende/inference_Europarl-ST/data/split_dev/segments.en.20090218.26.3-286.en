− Mr President, I have to say at the outset that I very much welcome the communication which has been prepared by the Commission.
I think it is both comprehensive and ambitious.
In my report, Commissioner, I recommend which practical actions, investments and processes are needed if we are to identify that very special place for children in external action.
The Commission and the Council communication and conclusions on external action will build upon the external dimension of the EU strategy on the rights of the child.
I believe that this is essential work for the European Union.
Commissioner, I now look forward very much to seeing actions intended to match the ambition which I see.
We need to see substance backing up the rhetoric.
That means that resources must be available and, of course – as I am sure you will agree – there must be no backtracking by the European Union Member States on the commitments they have made to fund the Millennium Development Goals (MDG).
What we know is that, for most of the world ’ s two billion children, it is a daily struggle against poverty and vulnerability.
As we know, 98% of the children in our world living in extreme poverty are living in developing countries.
Furthermore, it is now clear that the impact of the financial crisis will be severely felt by children and young people, for instance when the budgets are cut back on health and education.
That is why I think it is right that we make a political commitment, at the highest level, on behalf of and with children.
The EU must see in its partnership with the developing countries the opportunity to influence public policy to save children ’ s lives.
Priority actions for children must be promoted when the European Commission negotiates the country strategy papers ’ regional and thematic strategies, when they are drawn up, and subsequently when they are reviewed.
When there is budget support, including MDG budget contracts, specific objectives and indicators on children must and should be included.
I welcome the Commission ’ s intention to draw up partner national action plans for children.
We need assurances that even the most marginalised children – including children with disabilities and orphans – have access to equitable health, welfare and judicial services.
I believe there needs to be more and better training of Commission staff – both in Brussels and in delegations – particularly in how they manage the participation of children.
We need to see a radical rethink in the European Union about how we ensure that we listen to children and invite children to participate, because we understand that it is
children themselves who give lives to the values that are enshrined in international law through the Convention on the Rights of the Child agreed in 1989.
It is my experience that the children themselves – the young people – have a wealth of understanding and experience – which we must tap into – on how to tackle poverty and environmental degradation.
I welcome the fact that the Commission recognises the importance of consultation during the preparation of the EU strategy on the rights of the child.
I also understand that this has been planned for the first half of 2009.
Commissioner, would the Commission be able to confirm when this process will begin?
I trust there will not be any decision that the public consultation – including with children – will be put on hold until a new Commission and Parliament is in place.
Finally, to quote Kofi Annan, ‘ There is no trust more sacred than the one the world holds with children.
There is no duty more important than ensuring that their rights are respected, that their welfare is protected, that their lives are free from fear and want and that they grow up in peace.
’ I think all of us would agree that those are fine objectives.
