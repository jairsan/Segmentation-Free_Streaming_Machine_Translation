Mr President, very briefly, I am trying to be helpful, but am getting hungry.
These are important votes and it is a very full agenda and I have every sympathy with you.
I have just been down to the press room and I note that eight journalists are actually listening to the vote â€“ others may be watching on the screens, where every single vote is being broadcast.
I therefore think that to read out the result of every vote is not necessary.
