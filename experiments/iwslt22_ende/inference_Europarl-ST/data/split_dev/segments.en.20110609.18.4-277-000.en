Mr President, Ukraine is a democracy.
Therefore, we signal our concern to a partner, an ally, and a friend.
As we all know, nobody is perfect in this world, but it is in accordance with Europe â€™ s political standards and norms, and also in accordance with the logic and values of democracy, that we expect the Ukrainian authorities
not to abuse their power by encouraging and holding politically motivated trials, and instead to give those who are suspects a fair trial, rather than political retribution.
Yulia Tymoshenko and other members of the former government of Ukraine, who had long been the rivals of President Yanukovych, should not be regarded as collectively, or by association, guilty and responsible for what is perceived as a liability in political practice.
First and foremost, they are all citizens of a democratic state.
By no means are we offering a defence speech here.
Instead, we are merely reminding our friends how democracy works.
