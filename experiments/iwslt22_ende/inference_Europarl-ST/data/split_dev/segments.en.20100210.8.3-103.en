Madam President, I wish I could be given the time to explain to the Members of this Parliament the reasons why the Greek people are so sensitive about the issue concerning the name of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
Unfortunately, it needs more than a minute.
This story, going back to the late 1940s, is a sad story which ended in creating a false idea about them.
I can assure you that Greeks are neither nationalists nor expansionists.
All they do is resist the use of a name which is part of their own ancient historical and archaeological tradition.
I understand that the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, as a new independent state, is undergoing a retarded ethnogenic phase.
Serious academics in Skopje do not support the nationalistic trends of their Prime Minister.
They prefer to remain silent rather than expose themselves against the trendy phrase, which the Thaler report rightly remarks, is liable to increase tensions.
I would like this Parliament and the new Commission to try and contribute with a solution to the name issue, not by stimulating the nationalistic tendencies of the
FYROM Government, but by supporting the Greek view, which fights for a gentle compromise that would, finally, seem to satisfy the people of FYROM more than the people of Greece.
