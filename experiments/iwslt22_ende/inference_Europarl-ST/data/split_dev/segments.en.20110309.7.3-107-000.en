Mr President, first, I would like to thank the rapporteurs for the excellent work they have done.
It is quite heartening that we are speaking with the same voice as the European Commission.
Most importantly, I would like to thank them for defending the prerogatives of this House.
To my colleagues from the ECR, I would say that this is not grandstanding but legitimately asserting our role in this process.
In times of crisis, we need effective solutions, stability and predictability, and all these features can be achieved best when we avail ourselves of the Community institutions.
Intergovernmental solutions will not, in the long run, lead us anywhere.
Most importantly, if we are serious about fighting economic crisis and being competitive, we have to do it together, regardless of whether a given Member State is a part of the euro area or outside it.
Therefore, I welcome the fact that, in our position – voted on yesterday in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs of this House – we have agreed to open the mechanism to all countries willing to participate in it, thus dispelling the ungrounded fears of a two-speed Europe.
