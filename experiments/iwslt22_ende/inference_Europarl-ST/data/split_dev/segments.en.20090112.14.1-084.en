Madam President, let me join those Members who consider the second-reading agreement a well-balanced compromise, given the complexity of the matter.
It shows the way for further improvements in the sector, towards more efficient and safer plant protection products, and is flexible enough to
avoid situations in which the ban on certain pesticides would, in the final analysis, reduce the irreproachability of agricultural products.
In particular, I wish to welcome the improvement of the original Commission proposal aimed at avoiding the duplication of tests and studies and promoting non-animal tests.
I hope that this could have an impact on other, related sectors, such as plant protection product data requirements, which are right now moving through their own revision process.
Even if pesticides, in contrast to chemicals, are intended to be toxic and their safety assessment is therefore a special case, it does not mean that redundant animal testing should take
place or that scientific knowledge cannot develop in ways that will identify further redundancies and that further potential reduction in animal testing will be possible in future.
It should be noted that development and registration of new agricultural pesticides or plant protection products can use upwards of 12 000 animals in dozens of separate and often overlapping tests.
