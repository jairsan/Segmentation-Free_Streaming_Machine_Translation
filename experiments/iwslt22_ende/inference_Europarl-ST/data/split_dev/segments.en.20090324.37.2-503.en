Madam President, last year we voted with a persuasive majority in favour of the resolution proposing to ban the cloning of animals for food and the sale of any products from cloned animals and their offspring.
Ahead of voting on the legislation on novel foods we should recall the reasons for having been prudent and aware of risks for the health and welfare of animals.
We know, from our past experience with similar issues that tackle both food safety and ethical relations between humans, as the dominant species, and nature, that public perception depends very much on specific knowledge of the matter.
Consumers are increasingly sensitive about suffering and injuries to farm animals and therefore they have the right to be informed about the potential of cloning to cause pain and to waste natural resources.
Yet the development of animal cloning as a method of food production is being pursued without public awareness.
The problems with cloning do not concern just the welfare of animals, but also consumer confidence in food since it is believed that in Europe food is produced to a very high standard.
The Eurobarometer study from last October documented serious public concerns with regard to hypothetical future use of food products from clones.
This is linked to the sale of imported food, which could eventually be sold in Europe without being labelled as a product from cloned animals.
I therefore agree with the rapporteur â€™ s approach urging the Commission to come up with a separate piece of legislation on clones.
Among other problems which have been covered by the amendments tabled by my political group, I wish particularly to
support the sharing of information from animal testing so as to avoid the need for new tests involving animals.
Finally, many thanks to the rapporteur for her thorough work on this important piece of European legislation tackling food safety, as well as consumer protection, and animal health and welfare.
