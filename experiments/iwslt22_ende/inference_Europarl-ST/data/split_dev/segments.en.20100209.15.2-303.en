Mr President, all elements of this agreement are important but I want to focus on the bluefin tuna issue.
It is vital that we act now to prevent a stock collapse and to allow the numbers of bluefin tuna to recover.
In 2006, the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tuna agreed on an action plan designed to improve reporting and monitoring of stocks and inspection of vessels.
But it is clear that it is not enough.
The stocks, particularly the eastern stock in the Mediterranean, remains critically low and there is a very real risk that we will soon witness the extinction of this endangered species.
The Conference of the Parties to CITES should therefore agree to place bluefin tuna in Appendix I of the Convention, and the Member States and the Commission must do more to combat illegal fishing and to enforce agreed restrictions and quotas.
