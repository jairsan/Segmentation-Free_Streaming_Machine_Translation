Madam President, I find what the Commissioner has said rather disappointing.
I know that he is standing in for Mr Dimas and could not help but read out what was given to him, but I think we need rather more than that.
Environmental legislation is something that most people – perhaps all people – in this Chamber are in favour of – perhaps even including UKIP, who are apparently not here and are perhaps ironing their Union Jacks.
The trouble is that we do not know what is happening in the Member States, and the proposals from the European Commission go only a very little way to improving that situation.
We, in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, are still in favour of having a directive rather than a recommendation.
I do not, myself, see why we could not have a general directive regarding environmental inspections and specific rules attached to specific directives where that is appropriate.
Let me then turn to the question of an EU environmental inspection force.
It is perhaps a little strange that this idea comes forward from the mouth of a British Conservative – vote Blue, go Green – but we do need this, because, otherwise, the Commission is entirely dependent on the Member States for the information that they choose to give it.
It is extraordinary that nine years after the Landfill Directive came into force, Spain is now being prosecuted before the European Court of Justice for having 60 000 illegal landfills, taking up more than half-a-million tonnes of illegally dumped waste.
We think we know what is happening south of Naples.
The Birds Directive adopted in 1979 is still being widely neglected.
The Commission often finds that its prosecutions before the Court of Justice on environmental matters are initiated by private citizens.
I do not think that this is good enough.
We should tell the people of Europe that we cannot be sure that the environmental legislation which we are adopting is being complied with.
Given the fact that we are now looking at climate change legislation, that is very serious.
We must return to the issue of an EU environmental inspection force, which I fully support.
