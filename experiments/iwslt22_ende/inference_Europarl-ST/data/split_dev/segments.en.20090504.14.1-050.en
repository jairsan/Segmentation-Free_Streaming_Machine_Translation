Mr President, today is 4 May and this will be my last speech here.
However, 30 years ago today Mrs Margaret Thatcher was elected as British Prime Minister and she faced similar Socialist-caused problems to those that we face today: crippling debts, rising unemployment and public unrest.
She understood the solution was small government, individual freedoms and national self-determination.
Today the EU imposes big government, increasing central control and the erosion of the nation state.
I can also remember her saying ‘ no ’, ‘ no ’, ‘ no ’, words the EU ignores or does not understand.
She went on to make that now famous speech in Bruges that sparked opposition to the project.
The EU is a 50-year-old attempted answer to a 200 – year – old problem.
I maintain if the EU was the answer, it must have been a very silly question.
And, as they say in Star Wars, may the fourth be with you.
