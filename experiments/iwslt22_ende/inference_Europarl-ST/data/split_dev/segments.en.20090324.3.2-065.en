Mr President, the Committee on Regional Development and the funds put into the whole of Europe are the most important programme in the whole of the European Community.
I can speak for North-West England and say how very much these funds have benefited the city of Liverpool, in particular, over the last 10 years.
Looking onward to the future, I can see that city continuing to expand on the basis of these well-allocated, well-controlled funds.
I would call for more involvement of the private sector in the way that the funds are allocated, managed and controlled, because the private sector can always do a more efficient job than the public sector.
I would also like to emphasise how very invaluable these monies have been to the rural areas of the North West, where there are a lot of agricultural areas, which are vital to the whole economy.
Finally, let me say that I back Mr Becsey on his microcredit.
This is a very interesting development and essential at this time in the economic situation.
