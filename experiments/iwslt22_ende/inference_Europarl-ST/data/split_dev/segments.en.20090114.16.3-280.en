Mr President, returning from the Gaza Strip after seeing the massacre – predominantly of civilians – I feel the urge to express my wholehearted solidarity with the Palestinian people.
For 17 days, they have been facing the enormous Israeli war machine that is flagrantly violating international law.
I also express support for the peace forces in Israel calling for an end to this war.
After a long closure and siege that converted Gaza into the largest open prison in the world, the building of the shameful wall around the West Bank,
the continuous expansion of the settlements, and the effective division of the Palestinian land, the occupying forces have moved to the fiercest military operation.
In this, the rocket attacks against southern Israel – and I stress that I am against any attack from whichever side on civilians – served as the pretext.
The ending of the ceasefire against the background of the power games in view of the Israeli elections is an insult to a whole nation.
The UN Security Council has adopted a resolution.
Israel is a state, not an organisation; it is a member of the United Nations.
It has a responsibility towards the international community, and has to comply with this and all other resolutions adopted by the United Nations.
There should be respect for international law.
No impunity should be permitted any longer.
There should be a full international investigation.
The international community demands an immediate ceasefire, the immediate withdrawal of the military forces, access to humanitarian aid, and freedom of movement for the population.
Let UNWRA carry out its mission.
The EU has taken steps, but only at a humanitarian level.
It has to show decisiveness at the political level.
Use the clauses in the association agreements.
Stop the upgrading of relations with Israel.
Stop arms exports to Israel.
There can only be a political solution to this conflict.
There should be a full return to international law, which means ending the 42-year-long occupation of Palestine, and establishing a sovereign and viable Palestinian state, thus building a peaceful future for both Palestinian and Israeli children.
To save future generations, we need to stop the war now.
