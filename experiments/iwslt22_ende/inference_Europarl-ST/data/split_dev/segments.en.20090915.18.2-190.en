Mr President, there is a saying that if you are not at the table, you are on the menu.
The next decade will decide where Europe is going to be.
The current leading generation in Western Europe had a holiday from history.
We grew up in peace.
We grew up in a welfare state.
We made debts and passed them on to our children.
But history is knocking on our door.
We will have a sluggish economy for years to come; we are facing mounting immigration and are sustaining an ageing population.
Unfortunately, Europe does not have a culture of achievement.
The European dream is to retire to the French Riviera as soon as possible.
If we do not innovate and develop an entrepreneurial culture as you designed, Europe will be on the menu.
I count on your leadership.
May I give you one piece of advice: keep Europe focused on its core task.
If you fail there, you will fail everywhere.
Remain open-minded and do not propose a European tax because it will provoke a pitchfork revolution against Europe.
I have never seen a demonstration in favour of a European tax.
It is simply a bridge too far and you will only feed public anger.
I count on your sense of realism to get Europe at the table and not on it, and I wish you good luck in your second term.
