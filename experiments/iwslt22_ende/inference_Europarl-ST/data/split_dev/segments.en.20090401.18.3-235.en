Mr President, we are grateful to Mr Lax for his best efforts to achieve a compromise in such an ambitious project.
The Greens / EFA Group still believes that the amendment suggested by Parliament would be the best solution.
For example, there could be – and there will be – practical problems while dealing with the main destination, instead of our proposal to provide free choice when applying for visas.
The Council has agreed to the obligation of the Member States to cooperate only.
Unfortunately, the visa fee will be EUR 60 instead of the EUR 35 suggested by Parliament.
Hopefully there are a number of waivers and reductions for children, students and active youth.
Although it was not possible to achieve a compromise on issuance of multiple-entry visas by default, at least we have now an obligation to issue such visas in certain cases.
The right to appeal against a negative decision is also a big step forward.
Now, in many Member States, such a right does not exist.
As a human rights activist in my previous life I especially thank Mr Lax for this provision.
Of course, for my group, incorporation in the report on visas of the report on biometrics looked like a fly in the ointment.
We are against such a wide introduction of biometrics.
Still, we see some improvements in the visa policy, and therefore we will support this report.
