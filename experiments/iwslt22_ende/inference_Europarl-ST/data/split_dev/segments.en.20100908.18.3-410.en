Mr President, the current economic crisis requires resolute action towards the effective completion of the internal market.
If we are not ready to open our markets, including the labour market, to all European citizens, the losses will be higher than the gains.
Recent studies undertaken by the European Commission have proved that opening our labour market will be beneficial and that worries concerning job losses due to labour migration are totally unfounded.
This sort of scaremongering has been proved wrong again and again.
In 2006, British experts estimated that 300 000 Romanians would flood Britain in search of jobs.
They are still looking for them.
Nothing of the kind happened.
The truth is that there is no rational reason to maintain the labour barrier for Romanian and Bulgarian workers.
Past experience shows that workers from eastern Member States fill a gap in the labour market and take jobs that are not wanted or are not fully covered by the local workforce.
Moreover, there is no way Romanians and Bulgarians will arrive in Western Europe to take advantage of its generous welfare system.
Both Romania and Bulgaria have high enrolment rates in secondary and tertiary education.
Both countries have a highly skilled resilient workforce.
If the EU wants to make full use of its resources in these times of crisis, then political trust and economic openness should be properly established between Member States.
To quote President Barroso ’ s speech of two days ago in this House, ‘ we either swim together or sink separately.
’ To paraphrase this, we either work together or get unemployed separately.
