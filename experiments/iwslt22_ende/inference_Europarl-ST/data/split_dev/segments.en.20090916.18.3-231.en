Madam President, the Lithuanian Law on the Protection of Minors from the Detrimental Effects of Public Information struck human rights defenders and media people in Lithuania and beyond as overly homophobic and profoundly undemocratic.
Please let me draw your attention to the fact that this law was vetoed by the former President of Lithuania, Valdas Adamkus, but he was overruled by the Lithuanian Parliament.
In addition, this law has been severely criticised by the current President of Lithuania, Dalia Grybauskaitė.
The law was assessed in vigorous terms by the Lithuanian media, commentators, and civil liberties and human rights defenders, who stressed its homophobic substance along with its extremely dangerous political implications, such as censorship and self-censorship.
This law has little, if anything, to do with the protection of children.
Instead, it is against gay and lesbian citizens of the country.
Whatever the case, the equation of homosexuality with physical violence and necrophilia is morally repugnant and deeply disgraceful.
Still, it is difficult to believe that the adoption of such a law is possible in an EU country at the beginning of the 21st century.
Personally I take this law as an unfortunate move and as a profound misunderstanding, to say the very least.
Changes to Article 310 of the penal code and Article 214 of the administrative code are being debated in Lithuania ’ s Parliament that will criminalise, with the threat of a fine, community work or imprisonment, anyone involved in the promotion of homosexuality in any public space.
If this is not our slide to state-sponsored homophobia and criminalisation of public expression of our gay and lesbian citizens, what is it then?
Last but not least, this law is a disgrace, but even more so would be an attempt to obfuscate, trivialise and, in effect, justify it.
This is to say that I strongly support the resolution.
