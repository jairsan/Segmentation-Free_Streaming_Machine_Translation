Madam President, as shadow rapporteur for the Liberal Group, I would like to thank Malcolm Harbour and my other colleagues for their excellent cooperation.
This dossier is of great importance for all electronic communications users in the European Union, and the compromise we agreed in the end with the Council – and they were not at all easy discussions – was a balanced one.
There have been some important achievements as a result of the negotiations with the Council.
One of the great improvements in comparison to the first reading relates to access to the 112 European emergency number, and the obligation of operators to make caller location available without any derogation on the grounds of technical feasibility, at least for fixed and mobile telephone operators.
This is a major achievement since it will help the emergency services respond more efficiently, and will enhance the protection of all citizens ’ lives wherever they are in the European Union.
The provisions on traffic management policies were a controversial point in the report, but I strongly believe that the compromise protects users ’ rights to access content and use services of their own choice.
No one in this House ever wanted to restrict freedom on the Internet.
Our objective has been to allow traffic management procedures, as long as they are necessary, to ensure the best possible online experience for end-users, and as long as they do not restrict competition between service providers.
I consider the compromise to be totally in line with this objective, which is why I fully support it.
I also believe that all measures regarding access to, and use of, services should respect the fundamental rights and freedoms of all citizens, and this has also been safeguarded in the report.
Some among us may not be happy with this compromise, but I would like to stress that, despite its shortcomings, this is the best we could achieve with the Council, and I strongly advise you to vote for it tomorrow.
