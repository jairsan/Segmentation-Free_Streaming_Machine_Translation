Mr President, I welcome the opportunity to support this resolution.
The Copenhagen Summit was a disappointment in many respects.
The EU failed especially in demonstrating a unified and efficient approach to climate change treatment, as well as in strengthening its leading political position in this agenda.
I consider, therefore, taking this resolution, an act of utmost importance, in order to demonstrate the unbroken spirit and determination of the EU as the leading force in the world in combating climate change.
We have to enhance and promote further activities aimed at climate change treatment.
