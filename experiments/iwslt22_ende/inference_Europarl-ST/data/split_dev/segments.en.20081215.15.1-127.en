Mr President, there is a saying that compromises will never win beauty contests.
At first sight, this could be said with regard to the outcome of all the negotiations on the recasting of the European Works Council Directive.
Based on the Menrad report, adopted in this House six years ago, on the jurisprudence and on the experiences of management and labour in the last 12 years, the PSE Group has always asked for an ambitious revision of the Directive.
Too many workers ’ representatives are still deprived of the basic information and consultation rights as their employer refuses to grant them these rights.
In our view, however, these rights are an integral part of the modelling of all industrial relations.
The position of the worker as the stable stakeholder who stays in the company – compared to the job-hopping of management and the uncommitted attitude of the new type of financial investor – has to be reflected in the corporate governance of our companies.
With the advice of the social partners incorporated in the directive and the additional modifications reached during our negotiations, the PSE hopes to deliver some building blocks for a new dynamic.
The formal political procedure is almost finalised.
It is now up to management and labour to act.
Compliance with the directive, currently some 40%, is still much too low.
The PSE is of the opinion that this is not the end of the story; it is a new beginning.
The European social partners have the enormous challenge of convincing those companies that still refuse to comply with the directive.
We urge the European Commission to contribute to this task.
A new campaign is needed.
Recent research has demonstrated that companies with adequate information, consultation and participation of workers function better, especially in hard times.
The economic crisis and the restructurings that we have to face in the near future make workers ’ involvement in the decision-making process of our companies more topical than ever.
I would like to thank my opponent, Mr Bushill-Matthews, for the professional chairing of the negotiations, my colleagues from the other groups for their political assistance and the French presidency for their sophisticated approach.
Let us go to work.
