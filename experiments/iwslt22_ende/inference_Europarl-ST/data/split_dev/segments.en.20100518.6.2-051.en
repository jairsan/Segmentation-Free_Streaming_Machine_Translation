Madam President, I wish to thank everyone who has been working very hard on the seemingly never-ending story of SIS II: Mr Coelho and those in the field.
The issue of recurring delays and cost overruns is very worrying and, if not this, what else could be more telling about Mr Barroso ’ s management skills in his first Commission?
I believe that we should take these lessons which can be learnt here today and project them into the creation of a new IT agency, which could be situated in Tallinn.
This would be a win-win situation: while the French colleagues could keep the servers in Strasbourg, the new programming work would be done in Tallinn by competent
specialists with low management costs, thus avoiding a monopoly and embracing the idea of EU integration, and also giving a guarantee of data protection.
Finally, I would like to express my confidence in Commissioner Malmström ’ s ability to resolve these complicated issues.
