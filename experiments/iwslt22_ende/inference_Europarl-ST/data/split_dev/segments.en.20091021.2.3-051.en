Mr President, it is extremely important to fight the economic crisis, and that also means helping the small and medium-sized enterprises.
We must be committed to the outcome of the Stoiber Committee, and I want to hear from both the Commission and the Council whether they are committed to this process and what we are going to do, because we have to cut red tape.
Another point I would like to discuss is the Ankara Protocol.
The Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs said in a public interview in The Hague that Turkey will not ratify or implement the Ankara Protocol.
That is a statement in an authorised interview in of 7 October 2009.
What are we going to do?
We cannot, as Commissioner Rehn said in the Foreign Affairs Committee, just kindly ask again.
The deadline is 1 November.
What action are we going to take?
