Madam President, I hope my colleague, Michael Cashman, and our colleagues will regard my remarks as a supplement and as a token of appreciation, rather than a revision.
The MDGs allow us a unique point of entry into the human condition at the beginning of the 21st century.
Therefore, it is critically important to come up with a new and fresh perspective, instead of offering that of the 20th century.
It is a fact of our time that no development is possible without security, and.
This is why we have tried to offer a more balanced approach to the MDGs, paying more attention to such regions as Central Asia, where poverty goes hand in hand with a lack of safety, insecurity, instability, forced child labour and even slavery.
In addition to the autocratic regimes in Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan, ethnic violence recently broke out in Kyrgyzstan.
Dire straits, combined with instability and violence, may lead to a humanitarian catastrophe in the region.
If we need proof that no durable and sustainable development exists without security, we have it here.
In addition to that, we cannot forget about extreme forms of poverty in such European countries as Moldova and Albania.
Let us take, for example, some grave problems relating to health care.
In Ukraine and Moldova 300 out of 10 000 people suffer from tuberculosis.
The aforementioned countries do not fall into the category of least developed countries but they certainly fall into that of developing countries.
If the MDGs do not embrace the least stable and least secure countries, we will never achieve a viable, social and moral order there.
Therefore, the time has come to expand our horizons.
Although sub-Saharan Africa is crucial to us, we cannot confine the MDGs to this sole, familiar context.
We are facing new challenges and we have to react to them.
Last but not least, the MDGs are inseparable from the necessity to empower the least developed, developing and least secure countries so that they can shape their future themselves.
