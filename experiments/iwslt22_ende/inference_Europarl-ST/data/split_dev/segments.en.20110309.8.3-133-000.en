Mr President, I am sorry to prolong this but as it happens, the voting lists have been circulated to all the groups.
If this was an error, it needs to be corrected.
It is ridiculous, and disrespectful to the President of one of our Member States and currently in the Presidency, to call the Members back to the House, back to the Chamber, after he has spoken.
Let us do it now in the order in which it is on the voting paper.
There is no justification for changing this again.
