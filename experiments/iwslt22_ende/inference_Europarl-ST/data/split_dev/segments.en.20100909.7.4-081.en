Mr President, I would like to move the following amendment as a new paragraph 9a.
I will read it: ‘ Considers that the situation of Roma in Europe can in no way affect the forthcoming accession of Romania and Bulgaria to the Schengen Area, nor the rights of their citizens ’.
I hope the House can support that amendment.
