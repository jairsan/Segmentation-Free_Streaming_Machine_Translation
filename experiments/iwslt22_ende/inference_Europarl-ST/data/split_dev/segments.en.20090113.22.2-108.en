Madam President, I voted against this simply because the proposal has been hijacked in effect by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and Commissioners.
The rapporteurs yesterday boasted about standardisation, and yet this is allegedly a Union of diversity.
If there were one area where judgement, discretion and diversity are needed, it is perhaps this.
This was essentially an agricultural issue, but the Danish Commissioner for agriculture was nowhere to be seen at any time, and that is a disgrace.
The reason, of course, is because of a conflict of interests since the Danes fail to process their drinking water after it comes out of the ground.
Farmers in my part of the world feel totally let down and frankly insulted by the fact that there are some assumptions here that they do not know what they are doing, and they need to be told.
Essentially you have added yet another group to those in the UK who frankly loathe the European Union â€™ s interference.
