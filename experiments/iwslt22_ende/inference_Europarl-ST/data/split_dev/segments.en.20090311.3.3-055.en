Madam President, these three very extremely important reports have been drafted by Socialist rapporteurs.
This, of course, is not by chance.
The thrust of these reports, the amendments that will be presented by the Socialist Members to improve them, and also I think today â€™ s debate, show very clearly that there are distinctive policies: distinctive right-wing and Socialist policies towards the crisis.
The right-wing policy is pretty simple: the crisis is a bad thing but we need to be patient, it will pass; we need to take some technical measures and things will calm down by themselves and we must express our sympathy to the people who will be hit.
The Socialist position is much more complex.
We say that we must attack the roots of the problem, the roots of the crisis, that we must radically change the economic paradigm, that we must change and that we must curb all the speculation that has led us to this financial crisis.
This has not been a neutral crisis but a crisis inflicted by specific policies, mostly by right-wing governments.
