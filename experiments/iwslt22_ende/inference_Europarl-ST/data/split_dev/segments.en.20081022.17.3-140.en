Mr President, concerning Amendment 9, which my group voted against, it was crucial for the PPE-DE Group that the democratic process should be completed without any
short cuts that create a democratic deficit, especially now that, in the case of emission trading, the parliamentary process cannot be described in a flattering manner.
We have seen misleading tricks, manipulation and, finally, the rapporteur ignoring the political will of her own group.
This has become even more relevant given the deadlock in the Council last week.
The PPE-DE Group has offered a solution to the problem of damaging industry whilst advancing the climate change mitigation.
Therefore, not only EU industry but also the trade unions are supporting our benchmarking proposal to replace the costly auctioning system.
We are all united in the attempt to reduce harmful emissions.
There is no doubt about that.
The question is how to do it.
Our first concern must be our planet, but I contend that the measures needed to stop climate change will not be helped by the economic decline of the leading climate-friendly economies leading to unemployment in the EU.
