Mr President, the information about violence against Christians in Egypt and Malaysia is just the tip of the iceberg.
There are three points I want to raise.
First, Christians have become the victims of brutal violence in many countries of the world, not just two.
Second, Christians have become the single most persecuted religious group in the world.
The numbers are astounding â€“ in the millions, not thousands or hundreds of thousands.
Third, the reaction of European societies, European governments and the EU has, so far, been unsatisfactory: timid, faint-hearted, pusillanimous, politically correct, or no reaction at all.
We must act resolutely, or else those who persecute Christians will think they have our tacit blessing.
Do we really want this?
