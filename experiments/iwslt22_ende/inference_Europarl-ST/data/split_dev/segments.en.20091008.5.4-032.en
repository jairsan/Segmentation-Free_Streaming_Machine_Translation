That is an interesting question.
It takes historical research: have the centre-left governments done anything about it?
In my speech, I pointed out that the centre-left party is doing the same as Mr Berlusconi is doing in Italy, so the debate is about Europe, about freedom of speech and about threats to freedom of speech from either side â€“ left or right.
That is my opinion.
