Mr President, e-justice – electronic justice – can we say that such a thing is possible in an activity that is conditioned by human weaknesses and virtues, which are very human characteristics?
No! Can there be borderless justice?
As you said, no, again! Because this is a human activity, which is also very different in every part of the world.
Do those two ‘ nos ’ mean that we must turn our back on technological innovation?
Again, of course, no! We must try to exploit human innovation.
A portal for information: yes! Exchange of data: yes! Awareness of the interindependence of the judicial systems: yes! Contribution to the creation of a European demos: yes!
But for common faceless justice – and I do not say that you are doing that in your report – no! My father, who was a judge, would not be too eager for me to defend electronic justice before the European Parliament.
If I myself speak from the European Parliament to my father, who is in heaven, I can tell him that I know that justice will always be a man, his defender and a judge – not before God but before their conscience.
