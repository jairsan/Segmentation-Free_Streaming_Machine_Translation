Mr President, finally, after two years, we have received the report of the Special Committee on the Financial, Economic and Social Crisis, and I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Berès, and the Chair of the committee, Mr Klinz, for their work.
However, I must point out that it is thanks not least to the dedication of Mr Karas, the coordinator from our group, the Group of the European People ’ s Party (Christian Democrats), of Mr Engel and of our shadow rapporteur, Mrs Pietikäinen, that we have been able to present such a good document.
The crisis committee was originally intended to analyse the causes of the crisis and to offer long-term recommendations.
We have now formulated five recommendations under five main headings.
In addition, the report also analyses the necessary steps in the areas of competitiveness, energy policy, the EU ’ s internal market, migration and research, support for small and medium-sized enterprises, taxation, employment and training.
I believe that what we now do with these excellent recommendations is of crucial importance.
It is not enough to formulate the necessary steps – we now also need to take action.
The EU institutions need to play a stronger role in formulating and implementing joint measures.
In my view, the EU is at a crossroads.
Either we decide to take the next step towards integration or we allow the EU to drift apart because of the current differences over economic policy.
After all, just because the crisis committee has finished its work, this does not mean that the crisis is over.
The debt crisis poses an enormous challenge for all of us.
We need to face up to this challenge.
This is something that we are certainly going to do in the coming months in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
