Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am convinced that the progress to greater democracy in Russia is no longer stoppable.
I am also convinced, however, that our Parliament, our groups, the parties behind these groups and the foundations could, and must, do more to help Russia as good friends and advisors.
Since the Duma elections, there have been numerous demonstrations and the involvement of civil society has increased dramatically.
It is not only politicians who have taken to the streets; there are also many citizens, consisting increasingly of middle class, well-educated people and people who have educated themselves further through travel.
We need to step up our dialogue and increase our contact with these people and ensure that there is more people-to-people contact, including by dealing swiftly with the outstanding issues relating to visa-free travel.
However, we should step up our parliamentary dialogue now, too.
I know that some people think less dialogue is the right response to the elections.
I think that is wrong.
We need more talks with our colleagues from the State Duma in order to discuss and to persuade and to offer them our experience.
In so doing, we should present our views clearly so that our colleagues there can also learn from our experience and avoid the mistakes that we have made, and continue to make.
We will best achieve this through clear dialogue and by showing as little as possible of the superior attitude that we sometimes see in this House.
The Partnership for Modernisation is a good instrument for this purpose.
We surely all agree that economic and technological modernisation is not sufficient and that without modernisation of the law, politics and society, Russia, and therefore our joint partnership, cannot succeed.
