Mr President, Vice-President Reding, Mr Mavroyiannis, ladies and gentlemen, in July, contrary to existing laws, an impartial Ombudsman who has long campaigned against corruption was replaced by a government with someone who is willing to tow the party line.
Two pieces of emergency legislation were passed that drastically reduce the powers of the constitutional court and change the legal position for a referendum to suspend the president from office while the case is in progress.
An extremely dubious suspension procedure was pursued against the state president that was no longer under the supervision of the constitutional court as a result of the emergency legislation.
The quorum requirements of the constitutional court were ignored.
Finally, there are reports of irregularities in the electoral lists for the referendum on the suspension of the office of president, indicating that the electoral lists were even changed after the ballot was complete.
To cap it all: constitutional lawyers and advocates have received personal threats during the process.
As I read this list, you might think I am talking about a banana republic in some obscure part of the world.
However, I am, in fact, talking about reports that we received during the summer from Romania, a Member State of the European Union.
These reports and the discussions we have had to hold about them are disappointing and quite simply unacceptable.
I am therefore pleased and grateful that the President of the Commission and, above all, our Vice-President, Ms Reding, have responded in a committed and decisive manner, demanding an explanation from Romania.
It is unacceptable, however, for Prime Minister Ponta to promise the President of the Commission that the illegal and highly undemocratic emergency legislation will be repealed, while doing nothing at home in Romania.
On the contrary, Mr Ponta has exploited the opportunity to bad-mouth the European Union.
This is unworthy of a democratically elected prime minister and shows a profoundly undemocratic attitude of mind.
Thanks again to the Commission for its decisive stance.
The citizens of Romania and of Europe as a whole appreciate this.
