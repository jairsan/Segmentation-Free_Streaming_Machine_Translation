Madam President, Mr Almunia, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to refer briefly to two points. One of them concerns competitiveness, which is raised in a number of different areas of the report.
I would like to ask you to remember how many mining accidents we hear about in the media.
This is due to the fact that mining and, in particular, coal mining is going on all over the world, but unfortunately, the safety standards elsewhere are very low when compared with those in German or other European pits.
This may seem like overstating the case, but personally, I do not think much of competitiveness which is bought at the expense of miners â€™ lives.
However, if we are looking at the consequences for industrial policy of an early exit from coal mining, I would like to say that the European mining equipment industry is competitive.
I would like to invite all those people who believe that mining is an industry of the past and, in particular, Mr Klinz, to pay a visit to a mine. They will soon realise that mining uses high-tech solutions and that it is a question of whether or not we want this industry to continue to be profitable.
I know that this is not what the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe wants.
I am afraid that the mining machinery industry will follow mining production and move out of Europe.
