Madam President, Mr Magnette, Members of the Commission, firstly I would like to thank and congratulate Commissioner Oettinger for reacting so quickly and, above all, for contacting the responsible sectors and safety authorities.
I believe that this is the only way we shall find a solution.
However, I also believe that the all-embracing approach adopted by Commissioner Damanaki is also extremely important.
I am against ad hoc legislation.
However, catastrophes such as this suggest that the entire issue of energy should be examined.
I believe we are all now aware that this dependence on fossil fuels has many associated risks and that when we consider the future of energy supply in Europe, we must always take these risks into account.
That is why the vehement criticisms we sometimes make of renewable energy sources, whether the sustainability criteria for bio fuels or the negative visual impact of wind turbines on the natural landscape, must always be balanced against the fact that the alternatives are, in fact, the more dangerous, conventional energy sources.
That is why I believe it is important, despite the differences between the USA and Europe, that we should carry out a thorough analysis of the situation and, as Commissioner Oettinger has said, that we should take a close look at specific aspects of the legal framework, because in Europe, we have a highly fragmented situation.
This means that it can be very difficult for the individual to gain access to the law.
Prevention and, above all, European cooperation are extremely important in the event of such a catastrophe.
We must think this proposed solution of insurance or a fund through to its logical conclusion.
I believe that this is the only way to offer the oil companies a certain level of security in the long term.
