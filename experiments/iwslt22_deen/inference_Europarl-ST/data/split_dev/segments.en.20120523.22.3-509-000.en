Madam President, Commissioner, many of the previous speakers have already mentioned that we are on the way to losing a generation of young people.
I think that we all also agree that it is high time that something was done.
Initial proposals were made in January this year or in December, so we have already wasted a couple of years with nothing but declarations of intent and a failure to tackle things in concrete terms; instead, responsibilities have been shifted to and fro at European level.
I hope that is now in the past.
Single-minded austerity is destroying the jobs of our young people.
Growth creates jobs and training places, including for the young people of Europe, and also saves the costs of future social expenditure.
What we need now is a rescue package for young people, for young Europeans, that is given just as much priority as was the rescue package for the banks.
We found it easy to spend EUR 800 billion on rescuing the banks.
It was right, and it was important, but we have to do it just as vehemently for something that will be much more important to us in the future, or at least equally as important.
Alternatively, what about the EUR 82 billion that has not been spent from the Structural Funds? As the previous speaker has already said, we need to call off the money.
That would give us EUR 15 000 to spend on each unemployed young person in Europe, if that would simplify things.
Moreover, as the previous speaker mentioned, we also have to use the Structural Funds for this in the future.
Together with my shadow rapporteurs, I have started initiatives for my report on the Programme for Social Change and Innovation, so that we very specifically allocate funding for a youth initiative.
I hope, then, that I will also have the support of this Parliament, of the Commission and also of the Council in getting this funding, since everyone says that it is so important, and that this will also be anchored today in the other funds.
This money could be very well used for the future of us all.
