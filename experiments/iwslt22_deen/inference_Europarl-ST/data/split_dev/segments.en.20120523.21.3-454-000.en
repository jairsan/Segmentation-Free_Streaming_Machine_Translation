Thank you for your follow-up question, Ms Merkies.
In fact, the traditional business model is built upon the consumption, and even the wasting, of resources.
The manufacturer produces something, does not deal with the waste, the product goes to the consumer and perhaps also ends up being thrown away.
That is no longer acceptable.
We need a new business model in which the manufacturer is responsible â€“ from production through to recovery, to recycling.
Then, I believe, there will be new designs for products.
There are new responsibilities for recirculation.
That is the direction we must move in.
