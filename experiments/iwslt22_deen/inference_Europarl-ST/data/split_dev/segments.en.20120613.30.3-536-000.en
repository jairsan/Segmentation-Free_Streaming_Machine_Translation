Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to make an observation, having listened to the debate in this Chamber.
This subject is one for which the Chamber deserves to be full.
The unemployed of Europe deserve that.
The Treaty establishing the European Union lays down our employment objective, and there are so many reasons for taking a serious approach to this subject.
I would therefore simply like to make an observation: in the last plenary debate, you said something about youth unemployment that is incredibly important and which is relevant here; that is, that it is necessary to keep the bigger picture in mind, which is demand-oriented macro-economic policy.
After all, the unemployed cannot solve the problem of unemployment on their own.
In line with this, we must bear in mind our economic policy and, in particular, the multiannual financial framework and, accordingly, make available the resources that are due to the unemployed of Europe.
