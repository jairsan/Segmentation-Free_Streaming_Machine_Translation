Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we Social Democrats have made it absolutely clear that we strongly support Turkey ’ s future membership.
We will continue to stand by our convictions.
Unfortunately, we are not at all happy about the current policies of Mr Erdoğan and his government.
It is true that a number of reforms have been implemented and that progress has been made with democratisation.
In addition, the economy is booming. However, on the other hand there have been some very disturbing developments. New restrictions have been imposed on freedom of expression and journalists and politicians have been imprisoned.
We are also very concerned about the threat by the Turkish Prime Minister to freeze Turkey ’ s relationship with the EU during the Cypriot Presidency of the Council.
This is totally unacceptable.
Nevertheless, the process of reform and democratisation must continue.
It is also clear that Turkey is not a supplicant country, but a partner with which the EU is conducting accession negotiations on the basis of its own unanimous decisions.
Many people here may not have noticed this.
In response to the many people who are talking about values, I would like to say that I am horrified to see only traces of these values.
We must keep our promises.
I believe that this is a very good report, but unfortunately many of the speeches in this House have been of very poor quality, which is a disgrace.
