Madam President, Commissioner, I would first like to extend my thanks to the two rapporteurs for their excellent work.
The European Parliament has been working very credibly to combat violence, and particularly violence against women, for many years now.
To this extent, the initiative started by the Spanish Presidency of the time for a European protection order fell and continues to fall on open ears.
Scattered across the countries of the European Union there are currently around 100 000 women alone in victim protection programmes.
These victims sometimes move their place of residence, perhaps to another EU country.
We are currently in the process of creating a European legal area – a Europe of freedom, security and justice – as a European added value.
As a system of mutual recognition, the European protection order is an important part of this.
It is a matter of creating mutual trust in the national legal systems of Europe; but above all, of course, it is a matter of protecting victims of stalking – such as violence by former partners – throughout the countries of Europe.
