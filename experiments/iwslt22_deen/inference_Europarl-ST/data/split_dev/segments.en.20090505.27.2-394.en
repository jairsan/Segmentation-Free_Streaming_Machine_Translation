Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, a 14-year-old boy in Hakkari was beaten into a coma by a SWAT team policeman.
Another 14 year old, who was fleeing a police gas attack, drowned after falling into a river.
On 4 April two people died at a demonstration near Urfa as a consequence of a police operation.
At present in Diyarbakir there are more than 185 minors in prison.
Hundreds of democratically elected politicians and activists of the DTP have been imprisoned, including three party leaders.
There are more than 207 proceedings against DTP MPs.
Such is my reading of the present democratic process in Turkey.
The list goes on.
This repression began shortly after 29 March, when the DTP enjoyed major successes in local government elections in the south-east of the country and the number of their mayoral appointments almost doubled, while by contrast the ruling AKP experienced bitter losses in its much sought after Kurdish region.
In my opinion there is a link between the election success of the DTP and the wave of repression against it.
It was then heard from government circles that the extension of the DTP â€™ s election success right up to the border with Armenia was regarded as a security risk.
Instead of trying to understand this clear vote for what it is, namely an unambiguous message by the Kurds that a solution must be found within the system, an attempt is being made to repress this political success, and with police brutality, if necessary.
Unfortunately, I do not think that even the highly praised AKP has either the will or the determination to develop and push through a comprehensive strategy for the resolution of this conflict, which has lasted for decades.
As you all know, since the last progress report there has been no significant progress in the area of freedom of the press and of expression, recognition of the Kurdish reality, rights for religious minorities or civilising the military.
The ruling AKP must finally implement genuine constitutional reform and bring a new dynamism, which can regenerate the country constitutionally and democratically and accept its pluralistic, multi-ethnic and multi-cultural social reality.
Otherwise there can be no real democratisation in Turkey.
That should be clear to all of us here.
