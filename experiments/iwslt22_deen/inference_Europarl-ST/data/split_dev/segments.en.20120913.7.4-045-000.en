Madam President, legal, cross-border online access to orphan works is fundamental to the fostering of our diverse cultural treasures in Europe.
The directive to be adopted will finally enable public institutions in Europe – libraries, museums, archives and the like – to dig out orphan works from their cellars, digitise them and thus make them available to the general public.
After long and also difficult discussions in Parliament and with the Council, we have found a solution that serves both the individual rights holders ’ interest in the reasonable protection of their works and the public interest in the distribution of such works.
We in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, in particular, insisted that there must be a truly thorough and effective search for the rights holder whose rights are to be protected before a work is published.
If the rights holder makes himself / herself known at a later date, he / she should be due at least reasonable compensation.
It is also important that we have put a stop to purely commercial use of such works.
On the other hand, public institutions, especially in times of tight purse strings, depend on private bodies to assist them with the digitisation.
Public-private partnerships are exactly the right approach to take in order to make as many works as possible accessible to the public.
It is high time that the European Parliament finally made hitherto unused cultural heritage available to the public.
I would like to offer my sincere thanks to the rapporteur, as these negotiations were truly difficult and we had proposed various different ways forward at the outset.
I do not share the view of the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance that there is, to all intents and purposes, no value in this directive.
I take the view that, if that were the case, the review clause makes it possible to overhaul the directive after two years.
I am, however, quite sure that digitisation can get under way straight away now, and also that the necessary funds for that are available.
