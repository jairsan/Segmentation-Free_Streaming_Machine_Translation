Mr President, only recently, we held an international workshop in the large plenary chamber of our Parliamentary building in Brussels on Parental Responsibility and the Protection of Children, which I had the honour of leading.
In Europe, there are more and more vulnerable and abandoned children who should not be living permanently in orphanages.
It is therefore our duty as legislators to strengthen the right to international adoption within the EU in order to help these children.
Article 24 of our Charter of Fundamental Rights also demands this when it states: ‘ Children shall have the right to such protection and care as is necessary for their wellbeing ’.
Although we have the Hague Adoption Convention and a Council of Europe convention, these are not enough.
In practice, major legal problems still arise in connection with international adoptions.
In these cases, only international regulations which eliminate the differences in national regulations that still exist and replace them with clear and simple principles can help.
In this regard, and with all our legislative zeal, we must not lose sight of the fact that the EU must cooperate with the Hague Conference on International Private Law in order to ensure a coordinated procedure.
Thus, the EU should not reinvent the wheel in this area.
I welcome the Commissioner ’ s statements in this regard.
