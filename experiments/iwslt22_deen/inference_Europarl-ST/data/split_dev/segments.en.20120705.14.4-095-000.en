at the European Court of Justice, the necessity of which has also been accepted by the Council, has failed simply because the Member States were unable to agree on the Member States from which the extra judges were to be drawn.

vote on the proposed regulation and the first part today in order to relieve the Court of Justice of at least some of its workload, while leaving the second part hanging; it will hopefully be possible to bring this more important part to a successful conclusion by summer 2013.
On behalf of our citizens and businesses, I once again call on the Member States not to play their usual power games with the third estate and to afford it the respect it deserves.
