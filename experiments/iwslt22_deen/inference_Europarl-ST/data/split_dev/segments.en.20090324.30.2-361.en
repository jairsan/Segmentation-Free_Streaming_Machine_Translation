. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I would like to thank those responsible for both reports, which we in the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance support.
We are in favour of extending the activities of the European Investment Bank in the developing countries.
We have long campaigned for EIB project funding to adhere to social and environmental standards and to uphold human rights.
In practical terms this will now happen because of the Community guarantees for EIB projects.
We would like to thank the Committee on Budgets which has taken up this point and successfully followed it through with the Council. The EIB is a very important tool within the EU, which enables the social, environmental and economic development of the Member States to be controlled.
I would therefore ask for closer checks than those that have been carried out in the past on all projects supported by the EIB, to determine whether socio-environmental sustainability and profitability can really be guaranteed.
This is especially important in the current financial and economic crisis. For example, it would be a serious mistake for the EIB to support large-scale projects such as the bridge over the Straits of Messina or the Brenner base tunnel for high-speed passenger trains.
These projects require large amounts of machinery and are highly capital-intensive.
Support for modernising and extending existing infrastructures is far more beneficial in terms of the labour market and environmental impact.
The quantitative growth comes from an outdated philosophy of ‘ faster, higher, further ’.
We need a sustainable socio-environmental policy for both our citizens and the environment.
Thank you.
