Mr President, I would like to issue an explanation of vote on behalf of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament.
The question of the granting of discharge for the Council by the European Parliament has been an institutional bone of contention for years.
The Council and Parliament have not yet managed to resolve this issue amicably.
The European Parliament bases its argument for its right to grant discharge on Article 319 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and the corresponding articles in the Financial Regulation.
It goes without saying that the S & D Group shares this position.
We insist on Parliament ’ s right to monitor and evaluate the proper use of taxpayers ’ money by the Council.
So far, the Council has not been in agreement with this view.
At present, the Council argues that it is granted discharge along with the Commission budget.
The S & D Group does not share this view.
We want to see a clear and balanced procedure that has been negotiated with the Council and that sets out the rights and obligations of the institutions.
We are convinced that we should take the negotiated route first.
This is because the non-granting of discharge to the Council will have no impact, as the EU Treaty does not provide for any consequences for such an occurrence.
However, since the non-granting of discharge remains legally without consequence, the S & D Group decided to abstain.
