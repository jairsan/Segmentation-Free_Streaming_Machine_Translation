The European Union not only has obligations in relation to human rights within its territory, but also an international duty to insist on compliance with these rights and to criticise abuses when dealing with third
insist on compliance with these rights and to criticise abuses when dealing with third countries, particularly when we provide financial support through the European Development Fund to third countries like Uganda, which have entered into partnership agreements with us.
Accordingly, we actually have the right to comment when these third countries fail to meet the human rights requirements set down in such partnership agreements.
Hence, Uganda must respect international human rights standards because it was party to the Cotonou Agreement, which sets down our organised development aid to the ACP countries.
Just one year ago, we called on Uganda not to follow through on its plans for a law to criminalise homosexuals.
One year on, the situation has deteriorated.
There is still the threat of long prison sentences or even the death penalty.
With others, I myself demonstrated in front of the Ugandan Embassy in May of this year.
This had no effect.
We wish to emphasise once again that the EU is generally opposed to the death penalty and to homophobic legislation of this kind.
