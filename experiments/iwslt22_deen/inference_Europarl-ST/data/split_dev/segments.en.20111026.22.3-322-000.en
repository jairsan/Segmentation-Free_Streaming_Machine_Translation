. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, sexual abuse and sexual violence against children and young people as well as images of this are indeed among the worst possible crimes that anyone could commit against young people.
Our highest priority must be to protect the victims, to prosecute the perpetrators and to punish them in a procedure that follows the rule of law.
It is therefore good that, together, we have found a way to tackle this crime throughout the EU and to obtain a common basis for this.
In the Committee on Culture and Education, in addition to the issues of prevention, effective prosecution, information and more instruction in the use of media, one principle was particularly important to us and that was the principle of ‘ deletion rather than blocking ’.
I am therefore pleased that, after a long struggle, we have succeeded in stipulating the deletion of websites depicting sexual violence against children and young people.
The Commission proposed making it mandatory for all Member State to block these websites.
However, it is no help to any child at all simply to draw a curtain, so to speak.
Internet blocks are ineffective, imprecise, easy to circumvent and do not help to combat sexual abuse.
In contrast, they create a censorship infrastructure, an instrument for controlling communication streams and are thus a threat to fundamental rights.
In Germany, this has now been implemented.
I very much hope that this example will also be followed in other Member States and that they will not use the option of blocking, as stated in the directive.
