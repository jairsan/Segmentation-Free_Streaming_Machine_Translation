Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, political initiatives for developing fast Internet connections across the board are, in principle, to be welcomed.
However, the spectrum is a scarce resource and, above all, it is a public good.
It was therefore a particular concern of the Committee on Culture and Education that it be made clear that the spectrum is, and remains, essential for the fulfilment of a wide range of societal, cultural and social functions.
For this reason, it was particularly important to us that the requirements of the telecoms package for safeguarding media pluralism and cultural diversity were not thrown out by the back door.
Both public and private broadcasting are essential guarantors of media pluralism and diversity of opinion in Europe.
We must ensure that they can continue to fulfil their vital functions unimpeded in future, too.
The Committee on Culture and Education had therefore proposed that the 790 band not be opened in the first instance, but unfortunately, the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy did not follow our suggestion.
Although it is mentioned in several places that the interests of broadcasting are to be taken into consideration, the Committee on Culture and Education would have liked there to have been much clearer wording in this regard.
It was particularly important to us that, before spectrum allocation, clear regulations be laid down to prevent theatres and anyone using wireless microphones, for example, from being saddled with the cost of paying for a frequency change or for new technology.
We are all called on to continue to ensure a fair balance of interests for all parties concerned.
I hope that we will succeed in doing so in future, too.
