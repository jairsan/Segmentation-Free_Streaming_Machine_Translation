Madam President, I would like to thank the authors of the questions and the Commissioner for his statement.
The German Social Democrats are also in favour of mobility and the free movement of workers on the European labour market.
That is an important and key fundamental freedom.
Although the facts dispel all fears, the German conservative-liberal Government is also no doubt planning to refuse to allow all workers to fully exercise this fundamental right.
I find that very disappointing when I look at other European policy areas.
In contrast to other countries, Germany has not made use of the transitional periods in order to make the German labour market fit for Europe.
Time and again in Germany, I receive reports from colleagues from Romania and Bulgaria informing me of the methods being used in Germany.
I can tell you that these are almost always bordering on illegal or are actually illegal.
A further extension and a further denial of this fundamental right will only serve to promote fraud, undeclared employment and ostensible self-employment.
It is not the influx of workers from Bulgaria and Romania that creates problems but the lack of fair conditions on the labour market.
For us in Germany, these include the lack of a minimum wage and too little control of undeclared employment and combating of ostensible self-employment.
Therefore, we must also put the principle of equal pay and equal working conditions for equal work in the same place into practice and introduce it in a uniform way at European level.
Then, all workers within Europe will also be able to move around to work with dignity.
