Madam President, ‘ new skills and new jobs ’ takes the form of guidelines for the Europe 2020 strategy and represents an important step towards increasing employment and growth.
However, this must not mean that the labour markets are made more flexible unilaterally, without the involvement of unions and management, and, at the same time, that workers have little or no social protection.
Flexicurity, a combination of security and flexibility, has so far only been used by the Member States as a magic word which will allow them to gradually increase flexibility and also to make working conditions more precarious.
We do not want flexicurity under these circumstances.
A cheap approach will not create jobs.
We have established this during the discussion on the previous item.
Therefore, I would like to emphasise once again that we are strongly opposed to the single open-ended contracts proposed by the Commission.
From our perspective, offering contracts which will result in a lowering of social standards to young people who are starting work will not create one single job. Instead, it will play the different generations on the labour market off against one another.
Labour market reforms must be negotiated with unions and management and must provide robust pension systems, training, employee rights and social security.
We are very much opposed to interventions in the national systems for wage negotiations involving management and unions.
I would like to thank everyone involved. I hope that tomorrow, we will adopt this positive report which would be further improved by the two amendments from the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament.
