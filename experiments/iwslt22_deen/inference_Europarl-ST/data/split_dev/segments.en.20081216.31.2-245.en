Mr President, it is good news that the ratification process for the Treaty of Lisbon is continuing with the second referendum and that, perhaps, we will now get this Treaty in 2009 after a wait of eight years.
The bad news is that we are paying a high price for this and, in one area, too high a price, I believe.
For the time being, the reform of the Commission has been killed off.
Reforming the Commission was part of a package of reforms for the institutions.
I think what has been decided here will come back to haunt us in a few years ’ time.
When the seven states of the former Yugoslavia are members of the EU, the former Yugoslavia will have more Commissioners than the six large Member States in the Union.
This is a violation of balance.
This issue has only been postponed, not resolved.
I feel that there is also a lack of leadership on this question.
The Presidency of the Council – just like that of the Commission – has failed to set boundaries in good time.
We can see clearly that the ‘ no ’ camp are not satisfied; they will find new bones of contention.
We need to get a publicity offensive under way now and not leave the second referendum to the populists.
That is what we have to do now.
