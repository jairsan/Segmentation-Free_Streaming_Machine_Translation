Mr President, it is obvious that in times of crisis, the health of the bee population is not taken as seriously as it should be. This is a mistake however.
Albert Einstein once said that humanity would be able to survive for only four years without bees.
Mortality among bees affects agriculture, rural development, food production, the maintenance of biodiversity and, ultimately, our lives.
Speaking for Austria, I can tell you that there has been a 30% decline in the bee population in some regions.
It is important that this phenomenon should be researched.
I am therefore in favour of this programme of research and studies; however, this must not be our only measure.
We need specific controls through agricultural supports and a strict authorisation process for plant protection products.
After all, it is not just the Varroa mite that is causing the honey bee to die out â€“ modern agriculture also plays a significant role here.
For this reason, more financial support should be made available for research into improving the health of our bee population, prevention, effective and standardised medicines in the Member States and alternative options to clinical insecticides.
