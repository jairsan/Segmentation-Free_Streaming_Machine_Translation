Madam President, Mr Wathelet, Commissioner, I believe that we are all agreed, even the gentlemen and the few ladies among the Eurosceptic to anti-Europe fractions of this House, that the EU performs important tasks
and that the performance of these tasks represents European added value, because the nation states either cannot perform them or the final beneficiaries would not receive this money from the nation states.
The latter scenario is due, in particular, to the fact that the Member States would not invest savings, but would have to use them to reduce debt, whereas the European budget is largely an investor.
Thus, if we want to achieve the goals that are set here every week, we need an ambitious budget, and that means not less money, but more money in future.
In this connection, I believe it is important to emphasise that the national budgets and the European budget are complementary to one another.
The Council and the Member States behave as if money that goes into the European budget more or less disappears into a large black hole.
That is not the case; it is invested in goals that we have previously agreed on here.
We therefore also need, as Mr Böge proposes, a critical examination of the medium-term financial programme.
This, of course, can only serve to show that the Council cannot say ‘ yes ’ to the Treaty of Lisbon while, at the same time, putting forward one or other project for financing and then saying: but you will not get any money for its implementation.
If it is not possible, then we will resort to the necessary deletions of the budget lines that Parliament does not regard as priorities.
Ladies and gentlemen, we will have this discussion again and again while the EU does not have sufficient funds of its own.
What is important – no, essential – is that these own resources do not impose an additional burden on normal wage earners.
As a Social Democrat, I am in favour of the introduction of a financial transaction tax, because in general, this will not affect normal wage earners and it will help to put the brakes on the financial market.
We firmly believe that those who triggered a crisis, the like of which we have never seen before, and the costs of which we all have to pay out of the public budgets of our own Member States, should be called on to compensate for these losses.
