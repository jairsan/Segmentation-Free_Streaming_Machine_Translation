Mr President, Commissioner, rapporteur, in its role as guardian of the Treaties, the Commission ’ s position is not always a pleasant one.
Monitoring the application of EU law and having the competence to institute infringement proceedings against Member States means the Commission is not universally popular. This is, however, one of the Commission ’ s most important tasks.
In 2010 we had an acquis of EU legislation consisting of 8 400 Regulations and 2 000 Directives.
At the end of 2010, 2 100 infringements had been reported against these.
Although this figure is lower than in the previous year, it is still much too high.
Parliament is therefore also asking for correlation tables and guidelines on their use.
It should be possible to identify clearly from the tables which part of a Directive is being transposed with which national text.
After a 10-year blockade by the Council it is pleasing that there is now agreement and the Member States are submitting correlation tables in certain cases.
This will make it easier in the future to monitor whether a Directive has or has not been transposed correctly in a certain Member State.
The report by Ms Lichtenberger places citizens at the centre of European legislation.
It is important for citizens that they have legal certainty and know what rights they have within the single market.
If they are affected by or involved in an issue and have drawn attention to an infringement by means of a petition, for example, they must be able to understand the procedures and receive the information that is important to them.
We MEPs are faced time and again with problems that are based solely on the poor transposition of EU legislation into national law.
This problem must be reduced further in the future.
