Madam President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, the NATO Summit has made good progress.
It is good that it is being discussed here.
New strategic elements, such as civil crisis management and cyber defence, are moves in the right direction.
In particular for small, neutral countries like Austria, strengthening the strategic partnership between NATO and the European Union is of decisive importance.
Developing military capacity by increasing synergy, reducing duplication and improving arms cooperation will help everyone, but especially the small Member States.
There is still quite a lot to be done, in particular for us.
Europe must set itself some homework and make sure that it is completed.
The initiative of the French, German and Polish foreign ministers represents a step in the right direction.
In the medium term, we need a European defence architecture which promotes military cooperation between the EU Member States, which brings together civil
together civil and military cooperation between the EU, the UN and NATO and which gradually develops European defence structures.
Our goal must be to become an important security partner in the world.
We need to work on this.
