Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, without quotas I would not be a Member of this House, but I am also self-confident enough to say that I do not do my work badly, nor am I a bad politician.
I believe that the quotas fulfil their purpose, since, in the past, we had 100% male quotas, and the time has come for us to do away with them.
The reality is that there is progress when it comes to equal rights for women in Europe.
It may be at a snail ’ s pace, but fortunately the movement is in the right direction.
Especially in times of crisis such as those in which we find ourselves at the moment, it becomes particularly clear that there is still major discrimination against women in the European labour market.
Women are the first to be fired, in traditional female professions our salaries are currently going backwards in many cases, and women in executive roles continue to be in short supply, despite better qualifications from secondary and tertiary education.
Today we have discussed how women in Europe – and this is not news to us – continue to earn less than their male colleagues. It is not enough to talk about this and to debate it, however.
Ultimately, we have to also start to change fundamental structures.
Professions that are mainly occupied by women are, as a rule, less well paid.
We need new and more objective ways of evaluating work, while greater transparency in respect of salaries would also be an important step towards equal pay.
The culture of silence in business keeps women in the dark about the fact that they earn less.
If we had more transparency within companies, women could defend themselves better against this, and this needs to be tackled now, just as we need quotas on boards of directors, in executive roles or even in political positions.
