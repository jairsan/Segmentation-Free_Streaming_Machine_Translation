Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I regret the fact that this debate was put on the agenda at such short notice that the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy was not able to be here.
In recent months, Baroness Ashton has worked with the Council to improve internal EU coordination on cooperation with our strategic partners, including Russia.
With regard to her efforts to achieve a coordinated position, I think it would have been sensible to involve her in this debate.
None of the other strategic partners of the EU is as close to us as Russia, either geographically or in relation to our historic experiences.
This is why we take great interest in the internal political developments in Russia.
At this point, I would like to make specific mention of the work programme drawn up jointly by the coordinators of the Partnership for Modernisation, both in Russia and in the EU.
This joint work programme for modernisation contains important measures which will provide active support for the development of the rule of law in Russia.
This is the right way of ensuring that our partnership brings real benefits, in particular, for the citizens.
The initiative to modernise Russia launched by the Russian President gives the country â€™ s international partners the opportunity to begin a fruitful cooperation with Russia.
We must make use of this opportunity. As my fellow Members have already said, if the modernisation process is to be sustainable, it must not only be based on technological developments.
A modern Russian economy must be founded on the reliable principles of the rule of law.
Only when citizens and business people can rely on the rule of law will they have the courage to introduce innovations and make investments.
Let us take the hand that Russia has reached out to us and help the country to modernise.
