Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to mention two examples that annoy millions of car drivers daily because the internal market has not been realised in this respect.
The first example concerns what drivers are obliged to carry with them.
We have open borders and we drive our cars across all the countries of the European Union, but we find that all the countries have widely differing requirements as to what we must carry with us.
In some countries, you have to carry a set of spare bulbs, in others a high-visibility jacket, in a third country perhaps mud flaps or a respiratory mask, and now breathalysers too.
Failure to comply with these obligations has severe penalties.
It is time this was harmonised, and I would ask you, Commissioner, to take the initiative for standardisation in this area; I would also ask you to immediately restrict it to a high-visibility jacket, a warning triangle and a first aid kit.
That ought to be enough.
The second example concerns the registration of motor vehicles that have already been registered in one country and are then transferred to another country.
The motorist finds that he has to go through the whole registration procedure again.
That means a whole load of bureaucracy and annoyance, and a whole load of new costs.
I call on you to implement swiftly the regulation that has already been sent out, so that in future, once a vehicle has been registered once, it is registered throughout the whole of Europe.
