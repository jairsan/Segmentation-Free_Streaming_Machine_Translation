Mr President, Mr Kallas, ladies and gentlemen, transport policy is of great importance when it comes to protecting both the environment and people â€™ s health.
It is good that the European Union has a strategy covering the period up to 2020 in order to resolve the many problems in current transport systems.
We need to see a significant reduction in the environmental impact of road transport.
We need genuine innovations in this area to reduce CO emissions and also nitrogen oxides and fine particulates.
In addition, we must integrate air and sea transport more closely into our environmental strategy.
In particular, in the case of sea transport, sulphur and nitrogen oxide emissions are rising, and improvements are needed in this area.
The increase in the noise produced by transport is also a nuisance for millions of people, which impacts on their quality of life.
Improvements must be made in road transport, but also in rail and air transport.
I would like to mention the internalisation of external costs.
Company cars bring tax benefits and the airline industry does not pay excise duty on fuel, which means that we still have a great deal to do in this area. I would like to congratulate Mr Grosch on his excellent report.
