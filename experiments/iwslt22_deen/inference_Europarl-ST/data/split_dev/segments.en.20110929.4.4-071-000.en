Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mr Pirillo for having put this issue on the agenda because, after all, we have no direct powers here; however, we have to push the Commission on this.
As Mr Reul pointed out, however, it is not just about electric furnace steel; a whole range of industries is at risk of carbon leakage.
By way of example, I would mention the aluminium industry and the chemicals industry, which must also benefit from this aid.
I emphasise ‘ must ’ because it says so in the directive.
Our problem is not the Emissions Trading Directive and particularly not the amended directive, for the existing directive – which is effective until 2012 – does not contain this provision.
We have now expressly laid down in the new Emissions Trading Directive that enterprises that are at risk of carbon leakage will receive support for direct and indirect emissions.
The Commission must therefore implement this.
The problem is not the text of the directive – that has actually been improved, because we now have this possibility of compensation which we did not have previously – but rather that the Commission must now get down to work.
We also need a clear aid framework that is transparent, otherwise there will be hidden subsidies in different Member States and competition will really be distorted.
I would like to make it quite clear that some enterprises are urgently awaiting this.
They are already making losses or at least are not making a profit, because the certificates – even if they are given out free of charge – have been priced in by the energy companies.
If there is no light at the end of the tunnel for these enterprises from 2013 onwards in the form of aid that they will receive, then they may make decisions that can only be bad for Europe as a centre of enterprise.
We need differentiation depending on the electricity mix in the Member States.
We must not over-compensate, but we must not under-compensate either, and we need to keep pointing out that we do have benchmarks.
We are only talking about compensating the best 10% of enterprises.
That is sufficient incentive to be efficient and the Commission now needs to implement this.
