Mr President, Mr Barroso, Mr Van Rompuy, it is important that we all work together to promote growth and employment and attempt to eliminate the causes of the crisis.
However, our goal must be to learn from our previous mistakes and not to make those mistakes again.
One subject which we must not lose sight of and which is particularly important to me is the fight against poverty.
It is a pity that the European Heads of Government were not prepared to commit to implementing the Commission proposals on combating poverty as quickly as possible.
The message sent out by the Council last week is that Europe does not care about the poorest people.
The original goals have been watered down. All that remains are three key figures and the objective of lifting 20 million people out of poverty.
That is not enough and it is clear that there is a real lack of political will in this respect.
We had really hoped that the Commission proposal to reduce poverty by 25% would be adopted and taken forward, because poverty ultimately represents a risk for Europe.
