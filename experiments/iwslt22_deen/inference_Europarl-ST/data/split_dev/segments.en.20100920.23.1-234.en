Mr President, naturally, the fight against counterfeit goods has top priority, including here in this House.
Nevertheless, I have to say that I clearly cannot support this report by my fellow Member on Wednesday, as, among other things, I share the concern of very many young people and citizens that an attempt is being made here – for example in Article 22 – to make Internet blocks respectable again through the back door.
It is also deplorable that the terms piracy and counterfeiting have been used as synonyms by the Commission and also here in this report.
That will create additional legal uncertainty.
The term piracy is not appropriate for the use of non-commercial Internet exchange services.
This would de facto turn many millions of citizens into criminals, as is quite rightly pointed out in the alternative report tabled by the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance and the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament.
I am also very definitely against the establishment of a new authority.
I believe that the structures currently in place will be able to deal with this matter very economically.
