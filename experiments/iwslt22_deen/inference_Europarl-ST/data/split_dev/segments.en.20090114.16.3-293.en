Mr President, on Sunday, 11 January, we visited the border city of Rafah in the Gaza Strip, which is completely sealed off.
This means that the civilian population has no chance of escaping the daily bombardments by the Israeli army.
If you have not seen it with your own eyes you cannot imagine how much the people of Gaza are suffering and how urgent it is to reach a peaceful, definitive solution to the conflict.
We were all deeply affected on a personal level by the immensity of the suffering of the Palestinian people, and also of the devastation.
Therefore, I wish to reiterate, in the strongest terms, that the Israeli bombings must be brought to an immediate halt, as must Hamas â€™ rocket fire into Israel, and the smuggling of arms into the Gaza Strip from Egypt must also be stopped.
In addition, the borders must be opened immediately to allow into the area the aid deliveries that are ready and waiting to supply the civilian population.
We also saw doctors at the border ready to travel into the area to provide help, but being unable to as the border was closed.
Therefore, I would appeal once again for the borders to be opened to allow the assistance to be provided.
