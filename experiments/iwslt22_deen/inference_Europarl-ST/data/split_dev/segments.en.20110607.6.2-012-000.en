Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Commissioner Dalli for focusing on the patients first.
I would like to do the same.
Hundreds of people are severely ill.
Medical personnel in northern Germany are really at their limit.
Twenty-two people have already died.
Yesterday in the Council, a representative of another Member State, Luxembourg, said that financial losses could be recompensed, but human life cannot.
Therefore, I would firstly like to ask for understanding with regard to issuing a warning even if we are not 100% certain where the source is but only have a suspicion – that we also make this information public.
Of course, we still have to find the source.
I see that many people working for the authorities, with the support of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), too – my sincere thanks to the European institutions and to Commissioner Dalli for the fact that the European Union is also helping to investigate this matter – are really working very intensively on this.
Nevertheless, as a German Member of this House, I cannot stand here and say that everything is going well.
There have been a few problems in connection with the crisis management.
For example, the Hamburg Health Senator informed the public, which was the right thing to do, even if there was not absolute certainty with regard to the Spanish cucumbers.
The EHEC pathogen was on the Spanish cucumbers and it should not have been there.
Even the Spanish Members must understand that.
However, she informed the public first and only very much later, hours or half a day later, she informed the European Commission and the Spanish authorities.
That was unacceptable.
In this regard, we in Germany must also consider internally how we could manage this better.
However, together we should concentrate on the fact that the enemy is not in Spain or in Germany, but rather the real problem is the pathogen that we need to get under control and to combat.
My final point is that we adopted a resolution during the last plenary sitting on the subject of resistance to antibiotics.
Even though this pathogen should not primarily be treated with antibiotics, we have the problem that it is resistant to many common antibiotics.
This is a long-standing subject that we now need to tackle more quickly because next time, it could be the case that the pathogen has to be treated with antibiotics but, because it is resistant, it is not possible to treat it.
We need to work on this.
