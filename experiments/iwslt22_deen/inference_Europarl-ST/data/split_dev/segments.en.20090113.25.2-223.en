Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thousands of children a year fall victim to child traffickers and even more are abducted.
A current study shows that it is unaccompanied minors who are the victims of such crimes.
That is why we welcome the fact that the European Commission, in its amendments to the old regulation, now takes due account of children.
When we demand that children too should have their biometric data in passports from a certain age, it is not due to mass hysteria, which I really do not share, but because we want to afford our children better protection.
However, such protection can only be afforded if every child has its own passport with its biometric data and the names of its guardians.
As with all data collection, it is especially important to my group that the highest possible security is guaranteed when collecting, storing and processing the biometric data of all citizens and we must always be able to track who can access what data.
The Council â€™ s regulations and decisions which affect this point make provision for very high protective mechanisms and control bodies to prevent data abuse.
I have to say that I have fundamental confidence in my national authorities, unlike many private companies, some of which are able to pass unprotected data to third parties through scandalous security loopholes and receive due payment for doing so.
That is precisely why it is so important for national authorities to capitalise on their established credibility and work closely with the data protection authorities.
Contrary to what has happened here, this includes the European Commission honouring its legal obligations to consult European data protection officers.
I would like to congratulate my friend Carlos Coelho on the excellent work he has done for this Parliament.
Thank you very much.
