Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the democratic structure of the European Union is the subject of much discussion at the moment.
The Commission ’ s report on monitoring the application of EU law makes it clear that this is a complex topic and also involves the Member States.
Citizens have a right not only to European legislation being drawn up in accordance with democratic principles, but also to European laws being transposed so they – the citizens – as well as businesses can benefit from them.
Member States are also under a democratic obligation in this respect.
They are obliged to transpose the legislation.
If they fail to fulfil this obligation, they are infringing the European legal order and therefore the rule of law.
Observing this rule of law is, however, a necessary condition for the legitimacy of any form of democratic governance.
It is a guarantee for citizens that they will be able to benefit from the rights provided for in law.
The Commission ’ s reports show year on year that many Member States frequently flout the transposition deadlines for Directives.
As guardian of the Treaties, the Commission is therefore forced to institute costly infringement proceedings, which are embarrassing for the Member States.
Here the Commission must keep a particularly close eye on those Member States with very poor transposition records.
As Parliament we are also required to do this.
Our citizens are turning to us with increasing frequency with petitions and in this way drawing our attention to transposition infringements by Member States.
We must therefore make sure that communication between Parliament and the Commission is improved, so that infringements can be identified and remedied as early as possible.
We owe it to our citizens!
