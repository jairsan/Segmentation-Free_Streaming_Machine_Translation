Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, the Arab world is in the grip of profound change.
People are fighting for their dignity; they wish to live in liberty, in a democracy and under the rule of law, as we do.
It is our political and moral duty to give our full and committed support to people in the Arab world involved in this cause.
I was in Cairo last weekend and met many young people there in Tahrir Square.
The openness, confidence, courage and optimism of the young people in Cairo left a deep impression on me.
Egypt and other Arab countries now have the opportunity of democratic development.
This is also an opportunity for Israel, for it not to remain the only democracy in the Middle East besides Lebanon.
The change taking place in Arabia must be seized as an opportunity for peace between Israel and Palestine.
We must refrain from everything that is a hindrance to this peace.
This means that settlement building by Israel is a provocation to the Palestinians and the Hamas rockets are a provocation to the Israelis.
There must be an end to both. Peace between Israel and Palestine is possible â€“ two states living together peacefully within secure borders as good neighbours.
Now is not the time for pusillanimity and tentative dealings. Now is the time for courage, decisiveness and statesmanlike behaviour; now is the time for peace in the Middle East; now is the time for democracy in the Arab countries.
