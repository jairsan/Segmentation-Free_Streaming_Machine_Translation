Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the people in the Arab world are fighting for freedom and democracy.
In essence, it is about dignity.
That is also what it is about where Israel and Palestine are concerned.
Therefore, we are in a favour of Israel and Palestine living together peacefully as two states, each within its own secure borders.
We defend the security of Israel against any form of terrorism, but it is also true that the long-term security of Israel will be endangered if Palestine is denied its own state.
In other words, the security of Israel will in future only be guaranteed if it has a Palestinian state next door.
The best thing would certainly be for the negotiations to result in the recognition of Palestine as a state in the UN.
However, there is one prerequisite for this.
According to a report from the Israeli non-governmental organisation Peace Now, Israel has built twice as many houses in the Palestinian territories since the end of the settlement freeze in October 2010 as it has in Israeli territory.
In other words, it is taking away from the Palestinians the land that will form the basis of a Palestinian state.
That is not only unlawful, it is also sending Israel further into isolation, because Israel â€™ s settlement policy towards Palestine is illegitimate.
Therefore, if Israel does not declare a settlement freeze, there is no other option, in my opinion, than for Palestine to be recognised in the United Nations.
President Abbas and Prime Minister Fayyad are peace-loving people, and Israel will once again regret it if it does not make peace with these people.
Let us not harm the Palestinian soul. Let us not violate the dignity of the Palestinian people. Therefore, let us have Israel within secure borders and Palestine within secure borders.
The Palestinians are worthy of the same dignity as the Israelis.
