Madam President, the Lisbon agenda provided for a European home built on three pillars: the economic, social and environmental pillars.
We have often criticised the fact that the economic pillar is overvalued compared to the other two.
The social agenda has significantly strengthened the social pillar.
Our thanks therefore to rapporteur Mr Silva Peneda and the majority in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. We now have a document before us which is significantly better than the Commission ’ s original vague proposal.
In the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, we Greens made more than 40 amendment proposals and so contributed to a more concrete improvement of the socio-political core statements.
Social policy involves more! It must consist of more than just a few general demands for more jobs.
There needs to be more fairness in the distribution of goods, a committed fight against poverty, effective gender equality, social integration instead of exclusion, international solidarity, restructuring, respect for
fundamental rights and human rights – including towards immigrants – concern for health and the environment, so that working and living conditions can be improved, and finally there needs to be clear EU directives, which cannot be undermined by the European Court of Justice.
Much is now contained in this report which will be passed during this Parliament ’ s final plenary sitting.
We can only hope that the Council and the Commission will also take these demands seriously.
Only then can a social and solidly united Europe be built, a Europe which the EU ’ s citizens expect and will happily accept.
