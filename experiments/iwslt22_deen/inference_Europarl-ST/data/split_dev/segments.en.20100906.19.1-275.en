Madam President, La Macarena is not only a lively dance; it is also the name of a small town in the heart of Colombia that has achieved a sad notoriety.
In 2009, local farmers there complained of contaminated water.
La Macarena â€™ s gravedigger now claims to have buried around 2 000 anonymous bodies.
Coordinated by the organisation Justice for Colombia, a delegation of politicians and trade unionists attended a hearing in La Macarena.
Many of those participating marched for days through the jungle to tell their own personal stories of relatives who had been raped and threatened and who had finally disappeared.
The organisers told us two days later that they had received death threats.
We have seen the mass grave, which is guarded by soldiers who are themselves under suspicion of having been involved in the killings.
There is no country in the world in which more people forcibly disappear than in Colombia.
Ninety percent of acts of violence go unpunished.
The prompt conclusion of an EU Free Trade Agreement would only reward systematic human rights abuses in Colombia.
