Madam President, Commissioner, if I were a people trafficker, a terrorist, an opponent of a successful European Parliament or an opponent of democratic structures and decision-making processes, then I would vote for this report by Mr Cashman.
However, as I am none of those things, I will vote with full conviction against this report.
We are all in favour of transparency in political decision-making processes.
We are all in favour of better access to documents for citizens.
However, in his report, and with your support, Mr Cashman goes much too far.
Look at the definition of ‘ document ’, where he states that anything connected in any way with the policies, measures or decisions of all bodies and other institutions of the EU must be included.
That means that, if Mr Cashman ’ s proposals are adopted, all debates that we hold anywhere during the course of our decision-making processes within our groups or delegations will also be included.
If we make strategic preparations in order to protect the interests of Parliament, for example, in relation to the Council, these will also be included.
The content of informal trialogues, also in the interests of the European Parliament, or strategic planning discussions in Europol or Frontex, will also have to be included if you and Mr Cashman have your way.
It means that anyone who supports this report will make successful policy-related parliamentary work impossible, reduce the effectiveness of the European Parliament and help criminal organisations to carry out their work.
Anyone who votes for this report will not be increasing transparency for citizens.
Voting for this report will instead support political naivety and, in some areas, also the abuse of European laws.
Commissioner, I was very pleased by your statement, and you will certainly have the support of the Group of the European People ’ s Party (Christian Democrats).
You Mr Cashman, on the other hand, will most definitely not.
