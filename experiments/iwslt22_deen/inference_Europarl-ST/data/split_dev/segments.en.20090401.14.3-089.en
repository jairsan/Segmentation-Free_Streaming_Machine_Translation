Mr President, as the Committee on Culture and Education ’ s rapporteur for the new anti-discrimination directive on implementing the principle of equal treatment
of equal treatment between persons irrespective of religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation, I warmly welcome the Commission ’ s proposal and would specifically like to thank Mr Špidla.
Eurobarometer polls show that approximately three quarters of the population of the EU think that action needs to be taken in this field.
The Committee on Culture and Education called for amendments and additions in three areas. Firstly, the inclusion of gender.
We agree with the compromises achieved.
We wish to guarantee access to media and education, and regulate against multiple discrimination; some good compromises have been achieved here.
The Socialist Group in the European Parliament has supported this comprehensive horizontal directive.
If German conservatives and liberals now reject the directive in its entirety, they will be revealing their true colours: they want to continue to discriminate against gay people, and to broadcast propaganda.
There is no need to fear extremists such as Scientologists under the new directive: it will still be possible to reject advertisements or refuse to book assembly rooms.
The Committee on Culture and Education votes unanimously in favour of the horizontal framework directive.
