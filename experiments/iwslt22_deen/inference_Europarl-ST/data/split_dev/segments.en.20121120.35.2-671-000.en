Mr President, Commissioner, Council representatives, unlike the speaker before me, I am an enthusiastic advocate of the Schengen Information System for several reasons.
Firstly, we know that, as an investigative facility, the Schengen Information System represents a real success story in the area of security.
This has been proven.
Secondly, it is also a success story in connection with our open internal borders and freedom of travel.
After all, it is Schengen that forms the very basis for this.
Consequently, the system is a real success story for Europe in two senses.
If we now consider the second-generation Schengen Information System, we can see further progress, further development – on the one hand, because biometric data are also now entered into this system
are also now entered into this system and, on the other, because it offers multiple and improved data links – this too is in the interests of security – and because it also offers greater data security.
All in all it is a very positive development.
Previously it looked as if Schengen II would become a real never-ending story.
Now it looks as though we are hopefully reaching a conclusion and the data transfer can begin, with SIS II being fully available in the interests of the security of European citizens by the middle of next year.
I hope that the Commission will do everything in its power to ensure that SIS II really will be available, as promised, next summer.
I would also like to thank Mr Coelho, who once again has produced some excellent work in connection with Schengen and who has contributed to Schengen being a security success for the citizens of Europe.
