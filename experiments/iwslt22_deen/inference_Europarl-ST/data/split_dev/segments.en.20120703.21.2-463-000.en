Mr President, I have already finished my homework and, therefore, I would like to decide and to do so tomorrow, ladies and gentlemen.
This is not a legal decision; it is a political one.
It is about the question of whether we want an agreement to protect products which does not involve the countries responsible for the counterfeiting.
We do not! It is about the question of whether we want private individuals to be spied on by other individuals in future.
We do not! Do we want data protection not to be taken seriously in future?
We do not! Do we want civil claims to be handled in the criminal courts in future?
No, we do not! If we do not want all of this, ladies and gentlemen, and if, most importantly, we do not want to destroy the lives of young people in Europe, then we must vote tomorrow against postponement and against the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA).
That is definitely what I will be doing and I am calling on all the Members of the Group of the European People â€™ s Party (Christian Democrats) who have always said that they are opposed to ACTA not to delay and not to hope that no one will be watching them after the European elections, but instead to ensure that there is a vote tomorrow and that everyone can demonstrate their concerns.
