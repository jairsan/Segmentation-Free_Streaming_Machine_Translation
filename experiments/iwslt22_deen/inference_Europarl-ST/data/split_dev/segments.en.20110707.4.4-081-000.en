Madam President, 30 years after the first direct election to the European Parliament, we need a fundamental reform of the electoral system.
The shortcomings of the European elections are clear.
We must not stagnate, we must not stand still; instead, we must take the next step forward.
The next step is indeed this strategic instrument of European lists alongside the national lists.
Democracy involves discourse and deliberation, as Professor Habermas used to say.
That is exactly our problem.
The political class has a national system of discourse.
The debates remain in the national realm.
We have no overarching European debate, no European political realm, and the European lists would force the political class to come together and to
and to think in European terms, to argue from a European point of view and also to make the alternatives clear to citizens with regard to the forms of Europe they have to choose from in the elections.
I hope that we will succeed in implementing these European lists with your report, Mr Duff.
We need this vision, and we should not give in.
Parliament has already taken a decision in this regard once before, and we cannot be less ambitious than our predecessors.
