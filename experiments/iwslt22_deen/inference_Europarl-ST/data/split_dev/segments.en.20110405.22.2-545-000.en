Mr President, very few of our citizens are aware of the existence of European parties and foundations.
Until now these have simply been umbrella organisations for their national member parties, established according to national laws, mainly Belgian laws in this case.
What is it that these European parties do?
They discuss European issues, hold party conferences and play an indispensable role in reforming the European Parliament ’ s electoral system.
According to the Treaty of Lisbon, they are required to help establish European democracy – a political forum at European level.
The own-initiative report to be voted on tomorrow calls on the Commission to reform the legal basis for these European parties.
In future, these parties will be based on a European legal statute and will have a European legal personality.
As liberals, we have campaigned to ensure that a clear distinction is made between recognition as a European party and an entitlement to funding, as there was a certain greed in evidence.
It is also important that European parties should follow democratic principles in their internal workings, something that cannot be taken for granted.
