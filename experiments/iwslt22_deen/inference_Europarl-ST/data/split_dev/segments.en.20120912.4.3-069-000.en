Mr President, Mr Barroso, you have talked about the growth that is needed.
I think we all agree on that, but I would like to add something else.
Growth will not work without justice.
As long as the large fortunes of wealthy people in the European Union continue getting bigger and bigger and as long as the people who have to do the hard work are paid less and less, there will be no justice and, of course, no growth, because there will be no mass purchasing power.
Therefore, we need to make some changes to our systems.
We need a fairer tax system, in which large companies start to pay tax again.
We need fairer wages, which allow working people to benefit from the immense wealth that they create.
Most importantly, we need a fair market economy, which does not involve the shareholders being paid and, at the same time, the workers being made redundant.
If those changes are made, we will have a Europe for the people.
Otherwise, nothing will happen.
I have one more comment. Mr Farage, you have accused me of not listening.
I have sat here through the whole debate and listened carefully, unlike you, Mr Farage.
