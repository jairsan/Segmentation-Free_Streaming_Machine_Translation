Mr President, Commissioner Barnier, as a liberal, I, too, welcome the hearing instigated by the Commission on the future of European company law.
This is a key element of a functioning internal market.
There are particular problems in respect of the mobility of our enterprises â€“ in other words, the outstanding 14th company law directive on the cross-border transfer of company seats without having to establish a new company.
The Commission has been slow in presenting draft legislation because the Member States are unable to agree on a common line, and negotiations are therefore likely to be difficult.
Similarly, it is scarcely possible for shareholder rights to be exercised across borders and we are still awaiting harmonised framework conditions in this area.
There are also problems with the European private company, where the Member States are again blocking progress, being unable to agree on, among other things, the necessity of cross-border aspects, the level of capital stock and worker codetermination.
My final point is that in the current proposed directive on accounting, the Commission has, in my view, made a technical legal error.
In principle, the idea of making payment flows from the commodities industry in developing countries transparent is to be welcomed.
In terms of legal technicalities, however, this topic does not belong there.
If we want to help fight corruption, EU accounting law is not the right place to do it.
