Madam President, Commissioner, public services and social services are beset by enormous economic and political upheaval, the more so given national cost-saving measures.
In the European Union, we are facing growing income disparities.
Especially in times of uncertainty, the economic crisis and fears for the future, social stabilisers are more important than ever.
In my home city of Vienna, the basic idea of social housing consists of bringing about affordable housing for broad sections of the population and not restricting this – as defined by the Commission – to disadvantaged citizens or socially less advantaged groups.
The result of that is ghettoisation.
I thus have no intention of changing my opinion in this regard – it should be a principle or a right of local self-government to define social services, including social housing, at that local level and to exclude social services from the scope of competition and State aid law.
In any event, though, we need legal clarity in the European Union and a legal instrument at the EU level that covers and defines social services accordingly.
