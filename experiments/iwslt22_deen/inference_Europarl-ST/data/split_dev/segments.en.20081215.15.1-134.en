Mr President, a revision of the European Works Council Directive has been due since 1999.
This has resulted in a recast procedure – too little for a rapidly changing industrial landscape. It naturally requires an improvement in information and consultation as tools for creating a conflict-reducing business culture.
This is essential.
Transnational decisions belong in the advisory committee of the European Works Council.
The implementation of this inherently toothless directive must be legally strengthened and this should be linked to sanctions in order to ensure that it is possible to implement the directive.
This must happen so that the judgments of the ECJ will no longer simply be ignored.
Despite a small amount of progress being made, a revision will be necessary in no more than three years.
We could, and should, have done this now, in order to some degree to match the industrial political reality and this rapid state of change.
However – and this is the important point – at least something is happening.
