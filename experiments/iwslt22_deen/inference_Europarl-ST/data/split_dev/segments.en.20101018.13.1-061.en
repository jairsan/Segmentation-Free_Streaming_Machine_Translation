Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, what I feel is missing from this debate is the necessary distinction between national transposition in the Member States and the task that exists at European level.
We all realise that we need to take the special features of individual nations into account.
However, where the debate in Germany is concerned, for example, I must say that I can definitely see how Germany could implement this report.
What we are concerned with here is creating minimum standards at EU level to establish social framework conditions for women.
We are always keen to make reference to the ILO when it comes to good work, protection at work and protecting health, so I ask myself: why not in this case?
As far as the debate on costs is concerned, I would like to remind everyone in this House that in Germany – as well as in some other European countries – the anti-discrimination directive brought about a huge amount of lobbying on the part of enterprises.
There was talk of an avalanche of costs, of companies going bankrupt, of burdens on the economy and on workers themselves.
Looking back years later, how much of this happened?
None of it. I find this debate, this lobbying, very reminiscent of that time.
I urge you at last to put the economy on one side and to put people at the heart of what we do. I am not one of those merely sermonising here.
I have stated that I advocate a social Europe.
For me, that includes women.
In this situation, women need our help.
