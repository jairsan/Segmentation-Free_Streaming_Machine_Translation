Mr President, to date, the highly disparate rules in the individual Member States have resulted in injustice and irresponsibility in road transport.
For example, drink-driving or driving under the influence of drugs are not prosecuted and punished to the same degree for all road users in a Member State.
This directive should change that.
Without doubt, the opt-out facility permitted by the new legal basis remains a fly in the ointment and I hope that, if possible, no Member State will in fact make use of this opt-out for any extended period of time.
I also hope that there will be a large majority in the vote tomorrow, so that safety and justice on the roads prevail and that, under the new presidency, the Council will ultimately
will ultimately be able to push ahead and ensure that the correlation tables are introduced, so that we can verify if what is decided jointly in the European Parliament and the Council is in fact implemented.
