Madam President, I would like to bring a little reality to the illusion that has just been so elegantly produced because, from a culture and media policy point of view, the Council â€™ s Common Position is, in fact, a disappointment and unsatisfactory.
Frequencies are a scarce public good with considerable cultural and media policy significance.
As long as, for example, radio needs frequencies to broadcast its services, these are of particular importance for the freedom of the media and of expression in Europe.
The Committee on Culture and Education has put forward a series of proposals for how this can reasonably be taken into consideration.
Alongside clear wordings on the special role of radio and the consideration that it needs to be given, we warned that we need to open the door now to the second digital dividend.
We called for clear compensation rules so that it is clarified that switchover-related costs, for example for the new procurement of technology in theatres, will be assumed and that provision must be made for compensation for investments that made the digital dividend possible.
There is nothing left of all this, apart from the brief reference to the Telecoms Package and a few permissive provisions for the Member States.
I now expect the Commission and the Member States to at least demonstrate in their practical actions that they are aware of their responsibilities, that their dealings with this public good will not be solely in pursuit of economic benefit and that they are aware of its importance for media diversity and for the cultural interests of our society.
