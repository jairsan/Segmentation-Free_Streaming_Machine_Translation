. Mr President, Commissioner Barnier, ladies and gentlemen, the interconnection of companies and commercial registers is a further milestone along the way to creating a European area of law.
I am pleased that this matter, which is so important for our small and medium-sized enterprises in particular, and which I advocated and promised to work for during my electoral campaign, has now – following trialogue negotiations – been successfully incorporated into a directive.
There are two aspects to this. Firstly, it gives citizens and companies easier cross-border access to commercial registers.
Until now, if you wanted to access, say, a Greek commercial register, you had to instruct a Greek lawyer – who of course also had to speak your language, or at least a language that you had in common.
The end result was extra costs and wasted time.
This should now be able to take place via a platform.
What is special about this platform is that I can make an enquiry in my own language and get an answer in my own language.
Secondly, the commercial registers will now cooperate in a more institutionalised way, rather than on a voluntary basis as they have until now.
Moreover, I regret to say that in the past one could not always rely on the entries in commercial registers of other Member States, particularly where the registration of branches in other Member States was concerned.
We have now incorporated a requirement stating that, in future, entries must be made without delay or at latest within 21 days – provided, of course, that the conditions are met.
Every company and every branch is to be given an identifier.
The existing national commercial registers are not just kept only in their national language, but they also differ in many respects and; for example, as regards their legal significance and the reliability of the data recorded.
The directive aims only to interconnect the national registers in technical terms, not to harmonise the national systems.
Nonetheless, for practical business life it is an extremely helpful measure that will encourage further integration of the internal market and will improve legal clarity and legal certainty for companies and citizens.
I hope that the considerable technical work and software work that will be required for this can be achieved on time, by the year 2014.
