Madam President, Mr Koumoutsakos, ladies and gentlemen, the report on the Commission ’ s proposal for a programme to support the further development of an integrated
maritime policy is one way to achieve the objectives of the Treaty of Lisbon and to increase coherence between the various policy areas.
It is a welcome development that solutions have been sought on a cross-departmental basis in maritime policy and that an attempt has also been made to create synergies.
Maritime policy goes beyond marine transport and fishing.
Industry, research and alternative power generation, as well as environmental protection, are areas that are inseparably associated with the classic aspects of maritime policy.
For this reason, there is a need for improved coordination between policy areas and between Member States with access to the sea.
The report has improved on the Commission ’ s proposal on several counts.
In this context, I expressly welcome the fact that more attention has been paid to environmental protection, the protection of
and the sustainable use of maritime resources, an aspect which, I must say, could have been given even more prominence in the Commission ’ s proposal.
Mr Koumoutsakos, I hope that you receive a broad negotiating mandate for your report and would also like to thank Mr Milana for his work and wish you all the best for the future.
