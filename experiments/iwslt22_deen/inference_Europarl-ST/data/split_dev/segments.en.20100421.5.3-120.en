Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe there are a few things that are beyond dispute, like the transatlantic partnership – since it really is the foundation of our foreign policy – the common fight against terrorism and also the cooperation of the EU institutions.
However, the fact also remains that with the Treaty of Lisbon, we have acquired new foundations and, as the European Parliament, we have new rights and these rights must, above all, be exercised to protect our citizens.
One right is the protection of the fundamental rights of our citizens, as well as the protection of life and the protection of privacy.
Therefore we are in favour of the transfer of specific data.
However, the transfer of aggregate data is certainly going overboard.
The new agreement should give assurances of a balance between these fundamental rights, but also of reciprocity, proportionality and a minimum level of data security.
I would also like to ask the representative of the Council, the Presidency, where they were this morning when we debated the 2008 budget discharge – one of the most important chapters.
Unfortunately, the Council Presidency was conspicuous by its absence.
