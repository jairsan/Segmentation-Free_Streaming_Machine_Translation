Mr President, the European Works Council has been in existence for 14 years and it is high time that it was modified.
I voted in favour of the report because it will at last allow the European Works Council to be adapted to the new circumstances.
We have an abundance of so-called European companies, in other words those which work across borders.
It was therefore necessary to adapt the remit of the European Works Council to meet these new requirements.
We must support this report if only because it guarantees that, in all the companies where cross-border work is taking place and where
and where employees â€™ cross-border concerns need to be considered, the employees are actually represented in European Work Councils.
