Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the financial crisis has made it clear that the financial market framework of the European Union must be revised.
My Group supports the proposals developed in the trialogue negotiations, especially the proposals for a new Capital Requirements Directive for banks.
Risk-based supervision will increase, the abuse of special purpose vehicles will disappear and the quality of structured products will improve as a result of the 5% retention for securitisation.
However, I regret that the rule for in-year interbank loans is very restrictive and that silent capital contributions are accepted as full-value capital for a transitional period only.
The progress achieved with the restructuring of the financial market framework is good but not yet sufficient.
The work will therefore continue.
I hope that the banks will prove to be more cooperative than they have been in the last few months, when I saw them more in the role of a brakeman than a partner in search of forward-looking solutions.
