Mr President, Mr Dalli, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Ms Ries for her work on the report, as well as the shadow rapporteurs, in particular Ms de Lange, who has handled the matter very well on behalf of our group.
We have succeeded in achieving a good consensus on most issues in the committee.
I also wish expressly to welcome the compromise on special foods for coeliacs.
We have had lengthy discussions within the Group of the European People ’ s Party (Christian Democrats) and believe that it is important to continue to provide special foods in this context, because the point is not just that these foods are gluten-free – after all this can be assured by means of labelling regulations – but that a balanced diet is essential.
After all, if I just eat sweets for the whole day, I may have avoided gluten, but I certainly will not have eaten healthily.
That is why the question of balance must be considered.
We are particularly concerned about infants and young children.
The various amendments currently tabled should not create the impression that we somehow differ on the question of pesticides in baby food.
I was involved when the European Parliament pushed through harmonisation at the most stringent level possible in the 1990s.
We made it practically mandatory that only organic ingredients should be permitted in baby food, because the detection limit defines what we allow.
If the detection limit is to be lowered, then the Commission will have to come up with a new proposal.
I myself have worked in a paediatric clinic and I believe it is always important to listen to what specialist doctors and professional medical groups have to say on these issues.
At the time, these people advised us to put very strict regulations in place.
We followed this advice.
They are now telling us, however, that what Ms Ries and others in the Committee have proposed, which is what we have agreed, is also the pragmatic solution and that we do not need to go beyond this.
I would ask the Commission to monitor this.
When we have new detection methods, then we can do more.
Otherwise, this is a balanced proposal and we should not give the impression that we are somehow offering some children better protection than others.
