Madam President, this disaster happened off the coast of the US, not the EU.
It therefore affords us a real opportunity to learn some lessons and draw some conclusions.
Mr Oettinger said that this is the second time we have discussed this issue.
My committee has also held a major debate, and I am thankful to you that as soon as next week, together with the coordinators of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, we shall learn the results of your analysis, enabling us to continue our work into the summer recess.
I would support you on the imposition of a moratorium on extreme drilling in Europe.
We need to wait until we have identified the problems.
I would also support your call for European standardisation, stringent safety standards and a European supervisory authority.
As you have said, what we need is a system for auditing the auditors.
I like this idea a lot.
We would be happy to work on this.
Mrs Damanaki, I liked what I heard from you: this disaster must spur us to change.
The integrated maritime policy you have called for is a major project for the EU. I believe that harnessing the renewable energy of the sea, whether through deep-sea currents or other forms of retrieval that are yet to be invented, is a really key issue.
I believe that the institutions, including the Council, have demonstrated a determination to prevent such a disaster in Europe, as has Parliament, and will be happy to cooperate with you in avoiding such an eventuality.
