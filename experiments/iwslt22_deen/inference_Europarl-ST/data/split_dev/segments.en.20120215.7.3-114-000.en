Mr President, simply throwing money at the growth and debt problems in individual Member States will definitely not help to resolve them.
Merely blocking up holes is not a solution.
What we need is investment in sustainable measures to help these countries to help themselves, for example, in the areas of education, research, innovation and assistance for small and medium-sized businesses.
That will certainly speed up economic growth and job creation.
However, it is also important for the European Union to monitor whether the funds that are made available are actually being properly used.
Only under these circumstances will we gain the acceptance of citizens in particular in those Member States which have plenty of funds available and which have managed their budgets properly over the years.
All our previous experiences have shown that while trust is a good thing, a community based on solidarity also requires the necessary monitoring measures.
