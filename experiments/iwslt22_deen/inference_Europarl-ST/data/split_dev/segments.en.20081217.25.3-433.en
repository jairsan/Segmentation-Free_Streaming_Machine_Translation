. Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, these two recommendations of the European Parliament and of the Council should be a powerful impetus for continuous improvement of vocational education and training (VET) throughout Europe, through concerted planning, energetic implementation, assessment and review.
This requires greater transparency among a wide variety of VET systems, in order to enable comparability and mutual recognition of VET qualifications and ensure better permeability.
We are talking about a culture of continuous quality improvement.
A better education is more than just a matter of qualifications, more than a wider-open door to the labour market and also more than just a contribution to improving the competitiveness of enterprises and workers.
In that regard, it bothers me to hear such frequent reference to ‘ human capital ’, as though human beings were just a factor in production.
The status VET enjoys varies greatly among the 27 Member States.
It is true that we have no need of a bureaucratic harmonisation of provisions, of spoon-feeding by Brussels, as Mr Takkula has just said.
Yet we would do well to exert pressure, at least gentle pressure, to ensure that the best models and standards gradually win through in all EU Member States; starting now, I would say, rather than in the distant future.
We can and should learn from one another.
At all events, VET should enjoy the same status as general education throughout Europe.
I should like to thank both Mr Andersson and Mr Mann for their reports.
