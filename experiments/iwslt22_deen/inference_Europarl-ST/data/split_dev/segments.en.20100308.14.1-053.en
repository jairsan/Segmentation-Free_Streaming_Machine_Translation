Mr President, recent events in Turkey have once again confirmed that there are still insufficient guarantees for the rights of trade unions as well as workers.
For more than two months, 12 000 employees of the now privatised former state tobacco monopoly, Tekel, fought mass redundancies, short-time work and the loss of the social rights they had won.
Several times during the strike, President ErdoÄŸan threatened to have the protest camps in Ankara cleared by the police.
At the start of the strike, police attacked workers with tear gas and water cannon.
I would like to ask you to call on the Turkish authorities to treat trade unions as social partners with equal rights and to issue legislative provisions that guarantee the unconditional protection of trade union rights.
The rights must be tailored to EU standards and the ILO Conventions.
