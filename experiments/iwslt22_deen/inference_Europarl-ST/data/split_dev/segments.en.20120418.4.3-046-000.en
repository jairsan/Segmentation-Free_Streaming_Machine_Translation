Mr President, I follow the jurisprudence of the European Court of Justice closely.
In the past, the Court has gradually hollowed out a number of national control measures and declared them incompatible with the freedom to provide services.
The new implementing directive is now laying down new control measures which the Member States cannot exceed.
Minimum requirements are thus becoming maximum requirements.
I will point out just a couple of examples. From now on, documents are only to be translated if they are not excessively long, or Member States need to ensure that the formalities of the posting enterprises are as easy as possible to comply with.
Austria has already introduced a very efficient and effective law to combat wage and social dumping.
Are measures like this that are actually well suited to combating wage and social dumping now to be put in jeopardy as a result of this new implementing directive which, although well meant, in certain cases is only good in its intentions and not its effect?
