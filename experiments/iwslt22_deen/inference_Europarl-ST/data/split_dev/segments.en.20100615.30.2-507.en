Madam President, we urgently need this review. It is a few years too late and, because of this delay, the European Commission is, of course, getting caught up by one political reality after another.
These changes which were ushered in by the Treaty of Lisbon must obviously now also be viewed in the light of the financial and economic crisis.
When the Commissioner repeatedly says that we should now set ourselves political goals and priorities, I can tell him what, in my view, our priority should be: it lies in saving, specifically saving on administrative expenditure under heading 5.
We have a situation where we do not know the exact scale of the European Union â€™ s administrative expenditure.
The administrative expenditure of EU agencies, the decentralised agencies, is not covered by heading 5.
That brings me on to my question: what are you going to do to ensure that we can finally have transparency in our administrative expenditure?
What specifically are you going to undertake to ensure that expenditure is dramatically reduced?
