Madam President, I consider the debate on the reintroduction of border controls and the modification of the Schengen mechanism to be absolutely excessive and superfluous.
Moreover, we are only having this debate because Mr Berlusconi and Mr Sarkozy were thinking only of their national interests and acting in a populist way when they threatened to reintroduce controls at the borders between individual Member States on account of the migrants from North Africa.
I was also astounded – I must make that clear – at how quickly Mr Barroso, the President of the Commission, took up the debate rather than taking a corrective European approach.
Schengen is a huge achievement. Schengen is a European symbol and is the perfect combination of freedom to travel, open borders and security.
Schengen must never be brought into question. In special cases we already have the possibility of reintroducing controls for a limited period and in a limited region where there is a serious threat to internal security.
What we do not need, then, is a debate on Schengen.
What we instead need is a debate on measures to enhance Frontex so as to provide maximum security at the external borders of the European Union – thereby ensuring freedom of movement – and
ensuring freedom of movement – and a debate on speedy asylum proceedings and managed migration, on cooperation to deal with the causes of migration and on readmission agreements.
I am happy to go along with Commissioner Malmström ’ s proposals on this – her proposals are very broad – and I invite the Commission to follow Parliament ’ s lead, rather than the lead set by certain representatives of the Council.
