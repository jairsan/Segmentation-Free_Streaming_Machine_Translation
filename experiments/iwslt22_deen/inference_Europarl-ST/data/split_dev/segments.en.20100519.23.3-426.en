Madam President, as we know, the interlinking of business and universities has been a reality for some time.
This situation has led to the current mindless ‘ one solution fits all ’ approach whereby partly privatised universities are acting as controlling enterprises with the supposed aim of planning educational output.
Believing that such a partnership will contribute to modernisation all of a sudden only serves to show how lazy and uncreative our education policy debate is.
We are living in a time of technical revolution.
Digital systems are changing us, they are changing the way we act and think, our cognitive skills and, ultimately, our brains.
What we need therefore is a revolution in research and teaching that will adapt to this situation.
In such a time of change, continuing to preach the dependence of universities on this subsystem of our society as a step towards modernisation, despite the fact that such an interlinking has not led to any significant improvements in the past ten years, also ignores the importance of teaching and research for society as a whole.
What we really need in this time of change are scientific curiosity and creativity, but these arise from the possibility of free thinking and from not yielding to pressure, and that includes to the demands of the business world.
A young mind, a young brain with potential must be able to move freely.
What you have presented here in your report is the exact opposite.
This report reflects outdated and failed thinking.
The entire report is uncreative and I would even dare to say useless. It is clumsy phrases chained together across many pages to hide the fact that it lacks substance.
In the Austrian education system, you would be given a straight fail for this report.
