Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Group of the European People â€™ s Party (Christian Democrats), I would urge that we vote now.
We have had two months to discuss this subject in depth.
There has been a lot of discussion between the groups.
Then, in the last few days, pressure from the genetic engineering lobby was also added to the mix, and this has now caused confusion once again.
We are of the opinion that we have discussed all there is to discuss and that a decision can now be taken.
There are two arguments: our citizens are expecting signals from us with regard to how we are going to deal with biopatents, and the European Patent Office is also expecting clear signals from Parliament on how the current law is to be implemented.
That is why we should decide today.
