Mr President, Commissioner Dalli, Mr Karim, first of all, as rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, I would like to bring up a point that was very important to me in this report on subsidiarity and proportionality: for the
was very important to me in this report on subsidiarity and proportionality: for the first time since entering into force, the Treaty of Lisbon has shown its impact in the shape of the ‘ yellow card ’ for the national parliaments of the Member States.
For the first time, a sufficient number of the Member States ’ national parliaments have taken the Commission to task for its interference in the competences of the Member States and thus brought down a European regulation.
I am referring to Monti II, the proposed regulation on the exercising of fundamental social rights in the internal market.
In my view and, above all, in view of the efforts to get out of the crisis through coming closer together and increased cooperation, this is an important instrument for democracy from both a political but also, in particular, from an economic point of view.
Ultimately, we are all familiar with the discussions about the regulation of the financial markets – I only need mention the term supervision of the banks.
Especially given this background, I believe that democratic legitimisation and parliamentary control by this House, but also by the national parliaments, are important instruments for democracy that are being actively promoted but which must also be explained to the citizens.
Another point that I would like to raise in this debate is the section of the report dealing with reducing administrative burdens.
Obviously we all want – in all groups – to provide a sound working environment for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
However, I would like to specifically emphasise that a general exception from European directives for SMEs is not appropriate.
When it comes to rules governing health and worker protection, it is an absolute no-go, as these directives, after all, lay down rules governing minimum European standards.
There cannot be exceptions here, either for micro-enterprises or SMEs.
Quite on the contrary, the Member States can, and should, provide advanced protection for workers in their countries.
