Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, if we look at the statistics and trends, then one thing is clear: passenger numbers will increase worldwide.
I recently met with European airport operators and they forecast that passenger numbers will increase by around 50% worldwide over the next ten years.
What will this mean?
It will, without doubt, mean more and longer queues at checkpoints in airports.
If this is to be avoided, more staff are needed.
That will lead to an increase in costs and fares.
The alternative is to consider what new technologies we can introduce, in order to deal with rising passenger numbers, so that we can offer a more pleasant experience and guarantee security with higher passenger numbers.
If we succeed in developing and introducing security scanners that do not use any ionising radiation, that do not show real body images and that do not require any data to be stored and if passengers are also
be stored and if passengers are also able to opt for or against scanners during security controls, that would be an instrument that really would maintain security and give passengers a more pleasant experience during controls
.
However, I think that a debate on security scanners alone does not go far enough.
We also need to discuss what we can do to improve controls on air freight in the future.
Commissioner, when you next meet with the Council, you know that you can count on the European Parliament â€™ s support.
