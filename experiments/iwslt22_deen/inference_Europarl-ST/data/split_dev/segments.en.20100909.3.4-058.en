Mr President, Commissioner, I have just taken part in the debate on better lawmaking.
Postal market liberalisation is an example of a case where many of the negative consequences would not have arisen if – as in the report on better lawmaking presented earlier – an independent, reliable impact assessment had been carried out.
The Commission has not published a single study dealing solely with social conditions and the impact of postal market liberalisation.
The Commission only supports the national regulatory authorities in order to guarantee pure unfettered competition.
You are aware of the consequences of this: unreliable shipments, low-paid, poorly qualified workers, delivery now only on three days, different prices for different regions.
I therefore have a personal question for you, Commissioner. Does it not make your heart bleed to see in France being privatised against the will of the company management, the trade unions and the population in general?
