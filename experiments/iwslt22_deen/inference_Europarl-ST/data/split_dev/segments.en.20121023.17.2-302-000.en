Mr President, I do not wish to advance any political arguments against the ACAA Protocol, such as the idea that we are rewarding Israel for its human rights violations and sending out the wrong signal. Instead, I shall present some legal arguments.
The Protocol states that the territorial competence of the Israeli Responsible Authority for pharmaceuticals, in this instance the Ministry of Health, is to be defined by Israel – in accordance with its own national law, of course.
However, under Israel ’ s national law, the settlements in the West Bank, which are illegal under international law, and the illegally annexed areas of East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights are deemed to be Israeli territory.
Due to the absence of any provision to the contrary in the Protocol, the worry is that Israel will extend the jurisdiction of the Responsible Authority to the Occupied Territories as well.
When implementing the Protocol, the EU would thus be forced to recognise, for the first time, Israel ’ s claims to sovereignty over parts of the Occupied Territories.
I therefore urge the Members of this House to vote against the ACAA Protocol today.
As democratically elected Members of this House, we have an obligation to respect and uphold EU and international law as part of our set of values.
The Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to the EU because we apply rule-of-law and democratic principles – not only in relation to the EU itself.
How can we... this important...
