Mr President, Commissioner, the interconnection of companies registers is a technical matter, but it is by no means only a technical matter.
It concerns the greater European whole, and is about strengthening confidence in the internal market.
It is also about strengthening the reciprocal trust that Member States have in each other â€™ s legal systems.
This alone represents excellent European added value.
I would like to see this project go further; I would like to see it as a valuable step along the way, but not the final destination. Indeed, I would like our goal to be the setting up one day of a European companies register, and I hope that day is not too far off.
A lot of thanks have been given today, and I would like to add my voice to these.
Cooperation with the rapporteur, Mr Lechner, and with the shadow rapporteurs was constructive, and in particular cooperation with the Danish Presidency, with the Polish Presidency before that and with the Commission has also been extremely gratifying.
My main concern in this report was for the registers to be as reliable as possible.
Since we want all the Member States to participate, it is particularly important that we make it clear which Member State the data comes from and what its legal implications are.
At the end of the day, the differences are far too great.
A minimum standard of reliability can also only exist if any changes to the data are entered in the register without delay.
In the report the period for notifying such changes is limited to 21 days.
As a result, the registers should remain up-to-date and reliable.
Finally, Commissioner, you mentioned the cost aspect.
This is a further example of how constructive and how important it is to work together on this one step at a time.
The argument of cost savings of EUR 60 to 70 million is indeed a weighty one that should serve to help drive forward the interconnection of companies registers as quickly as possible.
This report is therefore a really useful one that will make life easier for citizens in particular, but also for investors, companies and supervisory authorities.
Let us carry on in this vein.
