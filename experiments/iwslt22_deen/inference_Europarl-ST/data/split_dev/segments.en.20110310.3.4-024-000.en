Mr President, Commissioner, I sometimes have the feeling that you should try out all these solutions on the Commission itself so that you could see what impact you are actually having on Europe.
Following your speech, I am left with the impression that the Commission really does sit in an ivory tower.
The people of Europe – the workers, the low earners and the pensioners – are really picking up the bill, and you are interpreting legislation and competences however you please.
On 19 October last year, I received a response to a question that I had put to the Commission in which it was explicitly confirmed that minimum wages and wages in general are the responsibility of the Member States.
The response states this very emphatically. Please read it. It is not acceptable for you to give me that kind of answer when it is a good thing for employers and then simply change direction when you believe something is good for the other side.
That will make the people of Europe really very unhappy.
My fellow Member has just mentioned this.
You are chipping away at codetermination.
You are weakening the trade unions.
That is not the way out of the crisis and you are fully aware of that. Those who caused the crisis must also be the ones to pay for it.
