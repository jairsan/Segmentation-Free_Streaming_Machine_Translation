Mr President, in order to bring illegal immigration under control, to meet the challenges represented by demographic change, to increase our competitiveness and,
competitiveness and, at the same time, to ensure a high level of social harmony, we need a joint immigration policy more urgently than ever.
This House is in agreement on this point.
For this reason, I would like to thank all four rapporteurs for their close cooperation.
However, for my group, a joint immigration policy must include all migrants, otherwise it will fall short of our requirements.
This means that the principle of equal treatment must apply to everyone without restrictions, in the case of employees ’ rights, access to education and access to social security systems.
Therefore, I would ask you to vote in favour of my group ’ s amendments tomorrow.
The Framework Directive must also apply to seasonal workers, refugees or temporary asylum seekers.
As far as the Blue Card is concerned, I would like to change the outcome of the vote of the committee responsible tomorrow in order to open up the European labour market not only to migrants from countries with which we already have partnership agreements.
There must be no restrictions of this kind and it pleases me to hear that the Commission shares this view.
Finally, another word to the Council.
In view of the occasion, I urge you to adopt both directives together.
If we are serious about equal treatment, we cannot adopt the principles of equal treatment first of all just for highly qualified workers and then later perhaps for other migrants.
