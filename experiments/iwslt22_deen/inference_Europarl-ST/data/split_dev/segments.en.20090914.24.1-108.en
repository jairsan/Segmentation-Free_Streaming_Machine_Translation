Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this is actually about finding a common European solution, rather than about national egotism.
Opel Europe has a significant role to play in industrial policy in Europe and this is not only about jobs at Opel, but also about jobs in many automotive supply companies in a number of European countries.
The decision in favour of Magna – and the European Works Council has confirmed this for me – achieved a consensus in the European Works Council, too, and its members are working flat out on European solutions.
The workers are ready to make sacrifices for this cause, and we expect the same from all the decision makers.
Everyone needs to work together, and to do so quickly. Previous speakers have already talked about this.
In the interests of the workers, it also makes sense, of course, for thousands of jobs truly to be temporarily stabilised with State aid.
We will not grant validity to any competition arguments that have been put forward.
We are dealing with people and with jobs, but also with whole regions.
The path that we were put on under Germany ’ s auspices must now lead to the best possible result for all European workers, across all European sites.
