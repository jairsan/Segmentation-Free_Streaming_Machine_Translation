Madam President, Commissioner, the figures are horrendous; it is hard to imagine that 155 million women worldwide are affected by genital mutilation.
We in the European Union must ensure that we bring about an awareness that puts an end to these practices.
In particular, we must work to achieve the banning of female genital mutilation in third countries and to create awareness there of how inhumane these practices are.
It is important that the victims receive psychological and adequate medical care, and finally – and this is particularly important to me – to make it clear that parents who do this to their children will be given prison sentences that act as a deterrent.
