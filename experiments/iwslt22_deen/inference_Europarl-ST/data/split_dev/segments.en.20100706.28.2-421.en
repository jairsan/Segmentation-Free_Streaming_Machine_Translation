Madam President, Commissioner, the financial crisis has highlighted that a uniform financial supervisory authority is an absolute necessity for the European Union.
The three EU-wide supervisory authorities which are envisaged for banking, insurance and securities should thereby be provided with the right to intervene directly in national institutions, such as Deutsche Bank.
These intervention rights are restricted to absolutely exceptional cases and will hopefully never be used.
As a member of the Committee on Legal Affairs, I regret that the committee responsible has not given any consideration to our constitutional objections regarding the envisaged intervention rights, both at European and national level, especially in the wake of the Lisbon judgment of the German Federal Constitutional Court.
A recommendation from the Committee on Legal Affairs, whereby the Commission, as guardian of the treaties, would act as the final decision-making authority within the framework of a set procedure, or, in other words, have the last say, was not followed.
On this point, the Committee on Legal Affairs recognises that the technical expertise required to make judgments is indisputably available in the national and European supervisory authorities and not in the Commission.
I hope that during the current negotiations, too, a solution will also be found to this constitutional problem.
