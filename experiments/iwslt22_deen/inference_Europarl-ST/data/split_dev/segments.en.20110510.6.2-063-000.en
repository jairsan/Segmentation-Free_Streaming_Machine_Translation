Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Ulmer for his noticeably factual contribution.
It makes a pleasant contrast to many of the things that I have heard said about the agencies this morning.
It is extremely depressing that many of the Members from the Eurosceptic parts of this House can never think of anything else but the agencies when it comes to budget cuts.
May I remind you that when these agencies were allocated it seemed that the prime ministers and governments of the Member States of the European Union could not get enough of these agencies on their soil.
Yet now people are acting as if they are the scourge of the European Union.
I am very pleased at the announcement of a study by the European Court of Auditors into the management costs of the agencies.
I believe it will provide us with a basis to at last have a more objective debate.
I am delighted – as I said previously in my first contribution – that the representatives of the Hungarian Presidency are here with us this morning.
That is not something we can take for granted when there is a debate that includes the discharge of the Council.
I would therefore like to address you directly, Mr Becsey.
I am pleased that the Council is prepared to recognise – as I took from the comments made by Mr Deutsch – that the budget proceedings and the discharge procedure must be dealt with differently.
This European Parliament is the people ’ s representation and it demands accountability for the use of taxpayers ’ money.
We will therefore not shirk from demanding that the Council be held accountable for the money given to the Council from the Community budget to finance its work.
Of course, there is plenty that we could negotiate on, such as what form the discharge procedure should take in the future.
However, I should like to ask you whether you seriously expect the European Parliament to negotiate on something that is our right under the treaties.
After all, that could only result in this right being restricted.
I fail to see why I, as a Member of the European Parliament, would do that.
Unfortunately, we do not have many opportunities to discuss things together and I would be delighted if you would take this opportunity to make it clear to us for once who it is in the Council that is actually fighting against the necessary transparency.
