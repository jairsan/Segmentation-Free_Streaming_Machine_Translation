Mr President, Europe will definitely be different after the crisis. The question is simply: what will it be like?
The other important question which we need to answer is: what sort of role should we and the Commission be playing?
I believe that if we have enough courage, we can bring about more Europe and, as has been said, this is what is expected of us.
Therefore, I am also calling on the Commission to be braver about tackling the problems, but, unfortunately, I think there is very little of this kind of approach to be found in the work programme for 2012.
Let us look once again at the area of implementation.
We are constantly adopting new regulations.
If we had correctly implemented the regulations which we have jointly produced, we would not be in the position that we are today.
We have the Treaty of Maastricht, which sets clear limits for public debt and net borrowing.
If the Commission had ensured over the last 10 years that these requirements were met, we would not be seeing the loss of confidence which all the Member States are now struggling with.
It is not the case that the Member States have suddenly plunged themselves deeply into debt. In fact it is the markets that have lost confidence.
Unfortunately, we and the Commission are also responsible for this loss of confidence.
Therefore, we simply need to do the things that we are doing well and to call on the Commission to put in place a zero-tolerance policy with regard to implementation.
The Commission is not brave enough to point the finger at those who are really causing the problems.
One of my main concerns is the environment, where there are similar problems.
We have excellent regulations, but many Member States are completely failing to comply with them.
We have fixed collection rates for electrical equipment.
Now we are being presented with a new proposal for new collection rates.
If we had implemented the old regulations correctly, we would not need this.
Therefore, I feel obliged to call on the European Commission to nail its colours more firmly to the mast, otherwise I foresee a difficult future for Europe as it stands.
