Mr President, Commissioner Reding, the vision of European contract law is clearly a wonderful one.
However, at the end of the day, it has to provide something positive for European citizens, otherwise the idea of European contract law is simply art for art ’ s sake.
Why does the report start with the most vulnerable parties here, the consumers?
The key element of Mrs Wallis ’ s report, the recommendation of the optional instrument, is an unreasonable demand for consumers, to put it mildly.
It is confusing for them, and in practical terms, it will never be the consumers themselves that are able to decide which state ’ s contract law they ultimately utilise, but rather their counterparts in the matter, in particular, big businesses.
In any case, now is not the time to say that the optional instrument is the last word on the matter, but instead we should look more closely at the other options, too – the toolbox that was mentioned and the contract models.
