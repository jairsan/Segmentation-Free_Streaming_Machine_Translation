Mr President, of course, it is true that there are serious economic problems.
That is very much the case.
However, the company management and, in particular, Mr Reilly, have breached a delta agreement.
Under the terms of this agreement, the Opel site in Antwerp was given the assurance that SUVs would be produced there. These cars are now not being manufactured in Antwerp, but in South Korea.
As far as I see it, this is, in very simple terms, a case of moving existing operations from Opel in Antwerp to South Korea.
