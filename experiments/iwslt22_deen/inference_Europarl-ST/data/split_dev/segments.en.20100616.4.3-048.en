Madam President, many of the previous speakers have dealt with the issue of the financial and deficit crisis.
I would like to talk about the Council ’ s conclusions on the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum.
Mrs Reding and Mrs Malmström have proposed a broad package of measures in this area which deserves our support.
The objectives of this package are to allow immigration, but in such a way that the people who come here have the chance to work and do not take jobs away from the people who already live here, to offer asylum
who really need it quickly and without red tape and to put firm measures in place to prevent illegal immigration and abuses of the asylum system
we need a coordinated European labour migration policy which gives the Member States the right of codecision on the basis of their social and integrative capacity.
We need a European asylum package that brings together the asylum legislation of the countries and improves the quality and efficiency of the process.
We need more effective protection for our external borders, accompanied by a stronger role for the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders (Frontex) and the visa information system.
We need a functioning repatriation policy which allows for the readmission agreements to be applied and we need visa facilitation, but only once the objectives have been laid down.
This applies to Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania, as well as to Russia and Turkey.
