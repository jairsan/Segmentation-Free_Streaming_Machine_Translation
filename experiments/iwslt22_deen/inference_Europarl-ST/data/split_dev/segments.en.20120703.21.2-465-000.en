Mr RÃ¼big, I am in favour of sensible copyright regulations.
I am in favour of a serious debate on intellectual property.
However, what does this have to do with the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA)?
This is an agreement which is intended to combat product piracy in countries which are not parties to the agreement. What does this have to do with ACTA?
This is an agreement which ensures that under certain circumstances, young people on the Internet will be charged with criminal offences without having committed criminal acts. This has nothing to do with ACTA and, therefore, I believe we should oppose ACTA.
We can, of course, discuss the other issues.
