Mr President, my fellow Members are right: the redundant workers are bearing the brunt of the crisis.
That is why we in the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance have so far voted in favour of all the applications from the Member States.
The EU funds measures that are intended to prevent long-term unemployment.
In our opinion, however, applications in which these measures do not form part of a social dialogue should not be approved in future.
We in the Verts / ALE Group are also critical of the fact that this financial instrument is being used to support workers so that they accept employment contracts that are below their previous pay level.
This especially applies to older workers.
Although they may feel that a bird in the hand is worth more than two in the bush, as far as I am concerned, that is not in the spirit of a social Europe – because at the end of the day, they are worse off and receive lower wages.
Moreover, there are repeated cases in which companies ’ redundancy programmes are practically adopted by the EU, particularly in the traditional automotive industry.
It is this industry that is profiting most from this indirect EU assistance.
In our view, this instrument should be organised differently.
It should not be used to plug financial gaps, but should instead be used strategically to work towards sustainability.
It should invest in green jobs and in the transition to a green economy if it is to be a genuinely long-term investment.
We also do not believe that this fire-fighting intervention by the European Union is really of any benefit for investing EU funds for the long term.
In our view, it is a fire-fighting measure for competition losers, including in terms of the transformation into a green economy.
That is why we need much greater intervention by the European Social Fund towards future-oriented further education and training, so that redundancies do not take place in
take place in the first place and our economy can be reshaped along ecological lines, making us global competition winners as a result.
