Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this is a rare event – so much so, in fact, that it highlights the importance of the discussions, the current revisions and the urgent need for action –
as this is the very first time that we will have adopted a proposal for a regulation from the European Commission on the structural funds for which there are almost no amendments.
I am relieved to find that we are so unanimous in our discussion of this proposal for a regulation from the Commission regarding the European
Social Fund, and I would like to thank you all for following my recommendation not to table any amendments in respect of the European Social Fund.
It is very clear that the financial and economic crisis demands that we all take responsibility, once again, for the optimum and, above all, rapid qualification of our workers, especially now.
More and more people are suffering from the effects that this international financial crisis is having on the labour market.
They expect answers from us, they expect protection and, above all, they need answers now and not in a few months ’ time.
The revision of the European Social Fund Regulation that we will adopt tomorrow will therefore enter into force immediately.
This will make a significant contribution to reducing the bureaucracy associated with the European Social Fund.
The allocation of funds has been made simpler and this will also speed up the disbursement of funds.
Application procedures that drag on for months and complicated methods of calculation, which until now were required to prove scheme participants ’ eligibility for individual bus and tram tickets, will be a thing of the past.
However, sometimes I ask myself why it has taken such a dramatic crisis for us to take this step.
Of course, it is never too late and with this revision we are at least ensuring that the funds can be used to the full and hopefully will also very quickly reach those who are most affected in the best possible way.
We must enable these people to be reintegrated into the labour market as quickly as possible.
They must absolutely not be allowed to slip into a longer period of unemployment, because at the present time it is easy to fall from there into a precarious situation or into poverty.
What has changed?
Or should I say what will change when we adopt this tomorrow?
In future, project applicants will be able to use flat rates in their calculations and also be able to apply for lump sums up to EUR 50 000 for each measure.
As for all of you sceptics, I would like to reiterate that checks on the correct allocation of funds will remain in place, as, firstly, both flat rates and lump
will remain in place, as, firstly, both flat rates and lump sums will be determined by the Member States themselves and, secondly, the Commission will examine in advance whether these – and I quote – are fair, equitable and verifiable.
The procedure does actually appear to be in order, as, surprisingly enough, our budget controllers had no objections to this regulation.
Thus, we are simplifying the procedure.
However, we are not changing the main priorities of the European Social Fund.
There is no reason at the moment for us to do this, as the project applicants are given sufficient scope to be able to react appropriately themselves to the specific needs of the labour market.
Finally, I would like to say that we are also making available to the Member States an increase in advance funds for this year of a further EUR 1.8 billion for training and
available to the Member States an increase in advance funds for this year of a further EUR 1.8 billion for training and further training measures and I think that this is a clear signal from this House that we are acting quickly in this crisis and are showing solidarity here.
I would like to apologise for the fact that I am unable to stay with this debate to its conclusion, as I now have to attend the Conciliation Committee for the Working Time Directive.
