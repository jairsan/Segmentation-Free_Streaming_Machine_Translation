Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to appeal once more to the conservatives and liberals that we cannot here place the interests of the self-employed above the safety of the people of Europe.
Entrepreneurial freedom is undoubtedly a very good thing, but the safety of our children and of everyone on the roads is more important – and that, to my mind, is the responsible way for Europe to act.
Tomorrow ’ s vote is an opportunity to show that you are not in favour of social dumping.
What this debate has also shown in recent months is that a debate on ostensible self-employment in Europe is long overdue.
More and more regular employment relationships are being ousted by ostensible self-employment, which is why we urgently need the situation to be analysed and a proposal to be made for what we can do about it.
As the Commissioner stated quite clearly today, we have had many declarations of intent on this matter.
It is time to act at last.
