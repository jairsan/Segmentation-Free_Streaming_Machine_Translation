Mr President, Mrs Napoletano, ladies and gentlemen, the Union for the Mediterranean should revive the Barcelona Process, which was launched in 1995.
Unfortunately, we must face the fact today that the recent Middle East crisis has meant the project has not come to fruition.
The opening of the secretariat in Barcelona has been postponed indefinitely, and the money promised cannot come in.
Thus, there have been no tangible results so far, which I greatly regret.
I ask myself whether we have been concentrating too much on institutions, and whether this is the reason for the current impasse.
Have we underestimated the influence of political crises on the Union for the Mediterranean?
How can we ensure the continuation of the projects?
In the history of European integration, we have been very successful in the economic and commercial fields.
It is for this very reason that we in the Committee on International Trade have considered how our successful mechanisms could be applied to our neighbours in southern Europe.
One objective is the creation of a free trade area by 2010, but this, too, has ground to a halt.
It is precisely because political conflicts are blocking this process that we should strengthen the economic field.
International trade could have a beneficial effect not only on the economic but also – and particularly – on the political and social situation in the region.
Regional economic integration is crucial in this regard.
Our southern neighbours must also cooperate more closely with one other.
At the same time, the countries that have already developed a network of bilateral trade relations should be convinced of the added value of a multilateral dimension.
Communicating the benefits of economic integration to local citizens will play an important role in this.
This would be one step towards stabilising the situation in the southern Mediterranean.
I wish to see this for the sake of us all, particularly the citizens in the region.
