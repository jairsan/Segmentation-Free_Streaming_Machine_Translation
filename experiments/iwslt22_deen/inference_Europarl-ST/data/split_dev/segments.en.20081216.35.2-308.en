Mr President, first, my compliments on the rapporteur â€™ s splendid work.
My dear Claude, a most sincere thank you! These guidelines now offer a great opportunity for us to push ahead with a new impetus with the energy changes that Europe needs.
We know that climate change, which is proceeding dramatically, demands a clear focus on renewables and energy efficiency.
What has been presented to us today as a compromise with the Council is a very good result.
The threat posed to successful national support schemes by the certificate trading that the Commission proposes has been deleted.
The flexibility that is essential if we are to reach, and I hope exceed, the 20% target together is provided by genuine cooperation mechanisms.
What is more, the national action plans that set out the strategy for the increase in renewables have been significantly sharpened.
On the one hand, the European Parliament has considerably improved the ecological criteria for biofuels, and on the other hand, it has added social criteria.
I therefore thank the rapporteur and I thank the whole delegation for this outcome.
