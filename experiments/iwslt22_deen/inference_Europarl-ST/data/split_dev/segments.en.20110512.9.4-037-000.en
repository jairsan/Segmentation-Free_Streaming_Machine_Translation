Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, through its report on the cultural dimensions of the EU ’ s external actions, Parliament clarifies its aspiration to also put our own stamps on this developing policy field.
The fact – and I want to put this carefully – that I do not see a representative of the External Action Service here today shows how necessary this report is.
The report quite rightly urges that, in future, cultural aspects should play a more significant role in external policy, into which they should be more systematically incorporated.
For my group, it was important to call for a coherent strategy that more effectively coordinates existing EU external policy programmes with cultural components, thereby taking account of cultural diversity in the EU.
Mrs Pack has already made reference to this, saying that the existing structures in the Member States and between them, such as the EUNIC network of national institutes for culture, must be incorporated and that civil society must be seen as part of European external cultural policy.
The EU ’ s motto of ‘ United in diversity ’ should also come to bear on the image that the Union projects to the outside world.
We should also make even better use of the new media as a communications platform to that end.
As we do all this, we need to make sure that art and culture do not become means to an end in external policy.
It is our cultural values that characterise our European Community.
It is therefore important and right that this cultural diversity and identity should also be disseminated outside the Union by its policies.
I feel sure that we can achieve much more in this way, including in the debate about human rights and democracy, than through many cases of sabre-rattling, sometimes with absolutely nothing to back it up, in this House.
