Madam President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I would like to raise two points regarding Mrs Haug ’ s report.
The first is that, at Parliament ’ s initiative, a separate budget line has been included under the heading ‘ trade policy for trade-related aid ’ – in other words ‘ aid for trade ’ – amounting to EUR 1 billion per year.
Unfortunately, the Commission has not yet been able to provide us with any detailed information on how these aid commitments will be implemented and whether they are operational.
It is heartening that the Committee on Budgets has incorporated an amendment proposed by the Committee on International Trade, withdrawing the Council's proposed 50% reduction in the figure for aid for trade.
My second point relates to the support for developing countries in pharmaceuticals-related technology transfer and capacity-building.
Over the last year, Parliament has taken specific steps to help the poorest countries with the supply of pharmaceuticals, and corresponding financial aid is clearly a part of that.
Unfortunately, it is clear that neither the Commission nor the Council shares this view, and, if I understand it correctly, the Committee on Budgets has, regrettably, also not included an amendment in that connection.
On Mr Lewandowski ’ s report, my committee has raised an important aspect of the EP ’ s work in the field of international trade relations: its involvement in the Inter-Parliamentary Union in the World Trade Organisation in Geneva.
As our Parliament is one of the organisers of its annual meetings, and given that important ministerial conferences will undoubtedly be on the agenda in the coming year in connection with the Doha round, it would be worth boosting funding for this in order to ensure that we have appropriate infrastructure options for participation.
In addition, we are particularly keen to assist representatives of the ACP countries to pay their travel and subsistence expenses in connection with the Parliamentary Conference.
Both of these elements can, and should, help to increase transparency and strengthen dialogue between parliaments, governments and the general public, and ultimately lead to greater fairness and legitimacy in the negotiations and decisions as part of the discussions within the WTO.
