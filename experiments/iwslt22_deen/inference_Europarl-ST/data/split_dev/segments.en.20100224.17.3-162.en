Mr President, neither party to the conflict has so far met the demands of the United Nations for a credible and independent investigation into the accusations of the Goldstone report.
This is regrettable, particularly on Israel â€™ s part, because, however controversial the Goldstone report might be, any state that calls itself a democratic state based on the rule of law is obliged to allow such serious accusations to be subjected to an independent investigation.
An internal military investigation by the Israeli army, which is itself under suspicion, is not sufficient.
If the EU takes its own principles of respect for human rights and international law seriously, it must increase the pressure on both sides, including in the context of its bilateral relations, and insist that the investigation that has been called for into possible violations of international and humanitarian law is carried out according to the principles of the rule of law.
War crimes must be punished under international law, as has been said here many times.
If necessary, the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court will have to carry out the investigations on the basis of Article 12 (3) of the Rome Statute.
However, irrespective of the Goldstone report, there is currently no reason to continue the siege on Gaza.
