Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, I am very pleased about this debate as it represents a first attempt for us to reach compromises on a very major project that will occupy us for the next few years.
The most important thing in these compromise resolutions of the European Parliament is the discrete nature of the cohesion policy and a clear commitment to that.
It will play its part in the Europe 2020 strategy, but it also has its own value, as it is cohesion policy that holds the EU together, at its core.
No region in the European Union is shoved to one side.
Social cohesion also means that no one, from the poorest of the poor, is pushed aside in the European Union, and instead, everyone is given a chance.
However, prosperity does not just mean economic growth, as we have seen in the past how there can be a growth of GDP in many regions, but an intensification of social differences at the same time.
I therefore consider it very important that, in this resolution, the impetus is given for us to develop other important criteria alongside the GDP that make it clear what prosperity means and what needs to be done in a region.
We in the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance are very proud of our achievement in having this fixed in the resolution, even if only cautiously.
We propose that the criterion is one which includes examining whether it is possible to support a region or not.
That would result in a very different picture.
Thus, the resolution comes out very clearly in favour of a ‘ GDP beyond ’ and we hope that the Commission takes up this stimulus.
That also means that we will finally get away from one-sided development.
A further Commission study – namely, the Commission ’ s Regions 2020 study – shows that climate change has an alarming and detrimental impact on regional development.
We therefore need to stop it.
The study shows that a third of the population of the European Union would have to abandon their homes if we failed to stop climate change, as they would either be unable to find work or to live in their homes any longer.
This makes it clear that there are three sides to regional development. All three of these sides must be given equal weight in the future reform of the structural funds and also taken into consideration in the support given.
One key interest is economic, social and territorial cohesion.
That means that ecological issues and criteria, too, represent a key element in the prosperity of regions.
Allow me to briefly enunciate one more thought about what has been negotiated here between Members, namely, the wording about how the ESF is to be dealt with in the joint package.
I believe that the oral amendment is well worded and allows us a great deal of free scope and I therefore ask you to support it.
