Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my contribution concerns the regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards the prohibition of highgrading and restrictions on
European Parliament and of the Council as regards the prohibition of highgrading and restrictions on fishing for flounder and turbot in the Baltic Sea, the Belts and the Sound.
What we are concerned with here is not simply the amendment of a regulation, but two very important and excellent species of food fish that we urgently need in Europe for our internal market.
Once again, it is clear that science and the industry need to work together to ensure that their experience – particularly in
the areas of discards and the management of stocks, but also as regards what happens to by-catches – is evaluated and assessed sensibly.
We know all the options for imposing restrictions here; Mr Gróbarczyk has set them out excellently.
It is essential that Article 15a is included in the regulation.
You have heard why – the rapporteur has once more stated it quite clearly.
Our common aim is to minimise by-catches and discards, and we achieved this in committee.
However, for some species of fish – and flounder and turbot are among them – it is the case that juvenile and under-sized specimens can be thrown back if they have been taken on board with the catch.
Naturally, it is also essential to work with excellent fishing gear here, to fish selectively and to respect closed seasons.
These two species of fish have constantly changed their spawning grounds, so naturally, the fishing areas have also been clearly defined, and the spawning times and spawning grounds described precisely.
The marketing parameters must not be revised downward so that the only possibility left is to make fishmeal from such excellent stocks.
That is not our aim.
We want to serve the market, which is why we have amended this regulation in this way.
