Madam President, Mr Karas has already mentioned some key points.
I fully concur with him on them.
I think that we need better capital requirements for financial institutions in both qualitative and quantitative terms.
One thing is therefore certain, namely that the Basel rules need to be developed further.
However, it does not help to force the situation as this could have totally the opposite effect.
The financial crisis is obviously a global crisis.
The lessons we need to draw from it must therefore be drawn at a global level as well.
This means that if we tighten capital requirements, we must coordinate this measure internationally too.
The level playing field must be retained. Judging in particular by the decisions that have been made in the last few days by our friends in the US, I have certain doubts about this.
Another consideration, which is especially important to me, is that the accumulation of current projects must not result in inconsistency.
For example, texts and annexes must remain consistent. Calculation examples in the annex must also match the wording.
However, the future supervisory authority will be responsible for the interpretation.
There is one other thing we should not forget. The financial economy and the real economy are not two self-contained systems.
Capital requirement regulations have an impact on the real economy.
However, at the moment we do not know exactly what this will be.
We therefore need at least to carry out thorough impact assessments before we make any further changes to the legal framework.
This has been the negotiating line adopted by the Group of the European People â€™ s Party (Christian Democrats) from the outset.
The compromise which has now been reached with the Council is therefore, in my view, the only sensible solution. I wish to thank Mrs McCarthy and Mr Karas, in particular, for the work they have put in to this report.
