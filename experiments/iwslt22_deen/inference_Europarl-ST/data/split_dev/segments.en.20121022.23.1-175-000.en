Mr President, all of us, regardless of group membership, want to offer medium-sized and micro-enterprises a good working environment.
They are major providers of jobs in the European Union.
We regard more growth and boosting productivity, together with excellent undertakings with good, skilled workers, as hugely important.
That is why we also need healthy and satisfied workers.
Your report, Mr RÃ¼big, sends out the wrong signal to the Commission in that regard.
It describes safety and health rules in the workplace as administrative burdens that must be subjected to the SME test.
By definition, however, health and safety standards that are set as minimum standards at European level are not administrative burdens.
You also say that Member States should not go in for what is called gold plating, i. e. must not be allowed to set higher health standards, and that the Commission should call for more harmonisation.
Given, however, that the health and safety rules are all minimum standards, more far-reaching protection of the safety and health of workers is always permissible.
And that should remain the case!
