Mr President, the risk sharing instruments proposed by the Commission is welcomed by the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance.
In technical terms, this proposal is based on the Greens â€™ proposal for project bonds.
In our view, investment in the real economy is the sure way for Greece to emerge from the crisis.
We could happily vote in favour of such a financial instrument.
The amendments to the regulation in no way guarantee the quality of these investments,
, as they do not provide for sustainable development or stable employment.
In the final analysis, these amendments to the regulation will simply result in the further expansion of the existing motorway network.
We want to see such incorrect plans revised and believe that the investments underwritten by all our citizens should be truly forward-looking and sustainable.
Therefore, we are unable to vote in favour of this proposal in its current form.
