Madam President, I have a comment to make on what our fellow Member has said about there not being enough German MEPs attending this debate.
Although I am a German Social Democrat, I share your criticism of the Minister of North Rhine-Westphalia, who is a member of the CDU, having said that he was pleased that it was the plant in Antwerp, rather than the one in Bochum, that was being closed down.
We, the German Social Democrats, are in favour of a European solution, in other words, the plan put forward by the European Works Council.
Let me say this very clearly once again: I have no idea why the German Conservatives and Liberals have shirked this debate.
