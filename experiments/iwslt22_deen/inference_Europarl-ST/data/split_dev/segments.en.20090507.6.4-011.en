− Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it gives me particular pleasure that we have succeeded in drawing up and adopting a new support programme for European films for the culture and economy of the European Union and worldwide within a short space of time – just six months – and before the end of this
up and adopting a new support programme for European films for the culture and economy of the European Union and worldwide within a short space of time – just six months – and before the end of this legislative period.
This was only possible because there has been exceptionally good cooperation, for which I would like to express my warmest thanks.
Thank you very much, Commissioner. The Commission ’ s proposal on the establishment of the MEDIA Mundus programme was an excellent one.
There was excellent cooperation with the Czech Presidency and cooperation in the Committee on Culture and Education was best of all.
Only as a result of this was it possible to achieve this goal in such a short time.
The promotion of European films through the MEDIA programme has been very successful in the European Union for some 15 years.
Ninety per cent of all European films shown outside their country of origin are promoted by the MEDIA programme.
So far, however, the programme has only promoted projects within Europe, and this promotion programme is no longer adequate at a time of globalisation of the markets and new technologies.
There are new opportunities, but also new challenges.
The MEDIA Mundus programme we are discussing today is a fantastic response.
It is a response to the opportunities offered to the European film industry by new markets outside Europe.
It is also a response to the need and the opportunities to use the promotion of films and films themselves to support and drive forward intercultural dialogue.
That is why I should like to express my thanks that the pilot MEDIA Mundus projects were launched.
EUR 7 million were made available.
It became clear that there was huge demand.
Training, marketing and distribution in global networks were supported by the pilot projects and, in particular, the
emerging audiovisual markets of the world – India, Brazil, South Korea, Canada – have submitted outstanding projects.
In this regard, with the vote of the Committee on Culture and Education we gladly vote in favour of the proposal.
I should like to ask the entire Parliament for a ‘ yes ’ vote to support this programme for the coming years with an appropriate
funding to achieve the objective of supporting the promotion of European films as global ambassadors for our cultural values.
This is my last speech in the European Parliament.
I feel very lucky to have been able to complete the programme with your support and should like to pass on my own message. Where future work is concerned, please
future work is concerned, please remember that cultural goods in Europe should not be simply economic goods but must remain both cultural and economic goods.
I should especially like to thank all my colleagues on the Committee on Culture and Education, in the secretariats, and you, Commissioner, and your Director General at the helm, Gregory Paulger, for ten years of excellent cooperation in the audiovisual field. Many thanks.
