Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, only simple and comprehensible law is good law.
We issue European legislation in the public interest and for the benefit of the citizens.
It is therefore essential that European law should be simple, easy-to-understand and accessible to everyone.
As European legislators, we need to constantly monitor and optimise our work.
That is what our citizens expect of us.
It is important that we should have an ever more intensive exchange with the national parliaments in order to give shape to laws and act together as guardians of the principle of subsidiarity.
In that way, we can ensure, together, that we really do only legislate at European level what is too much to deal with at national level.
Good law making also includes not putting in place regulations that could be at least as well dealt with at national level.
Particularly in these difficult times for the European Union, it is absolutely critical that European legislation should be accepted by everyone, including by our national elected representatives.
The early warning mechanism established in the Treaty of Lisbon, which many people have labelled a paper tiger, showed its potential power for the first time yesterday.
After reprimands about subsidiarity from 18 national parliaments, the Commission decided to withdraw its proposed regulation on collective striking law.
There is cause to criticise the fact that there has still been no updating of the existing interinstitutional agreement on better legislation from 2003 to fit in with the Treaty of Lisbon.
The Treaty of Lisbon brought in changes in respect of secondary legislation.
Given the immense practical importance of such legislation, the agreement needs to be updated.
