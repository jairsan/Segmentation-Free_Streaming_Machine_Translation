Madam President, what we are looking at here is how security can be guaranteed in the European Union in the long term.
That was the case with the last report and indirectly it is, in fact, the objective here.
We can ask for all the strategies we like from Commissioner Malmström, but if we do not succeed in implementing these strategies and, in parallel with this, applying criminal law across Europe, then all our initiatives and all our strategies will be useless.
I am therefore in favour of us doing everything we can to harmonise criminal law across Europe, naturally taking into account national traditions, but nonetheless it must be our goal to use
harmonised criminal law to implement what we have developed in the area of security in the way of initiatives, what has already been achieved in this area – from border protection, through the fight against organised crime, to cybercrime.
