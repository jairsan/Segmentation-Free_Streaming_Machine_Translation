Madam President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, I am very pleased that a package of measures aimed at combating child abuse has been agreed, protecting the weakest members of our society, namely our children.
In future, the European Union as a whole is to have mandatory minimum sentencing for child abuse, child prostitution, child pornography and child sex tourism.
Internet providers and travel agents, who indirectly profit from these shameful acts, can expect stringent penalties.
Child sex tourism will be subject to criminal prosecution in all Member States, even if the crime itself was committed outside the European Union.
For me it is also important that Member States should be obliged to shut down child pornography sites and to block access to foreign sites.
I am convinced that our resolution on the excellent Angelilli report will effectively combat child abuse and child pornography and provide greater protection for the weakest members of our society.
