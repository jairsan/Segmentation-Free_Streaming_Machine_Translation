Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office, I have listened to you very carefully.
The Greens are in favour of dialogue, but we are only in favour of critical dialogue, in other words dialogue which does not pay a dictator lip service.
Dialogue must be used to achieve progress in human rights policy in this country, for example so that the European University for Humanistics can legally
can legally return or so that freedom of expression is no longer restricted or so that demonstrations such as today ’ s can take place unimpeded.
Dialogue must strengthen the democratic forces.
Only then does it make sense.
It should not stab the democratic forces in the back. Human rights issues must be addressed as the core issue at this point and the EU ’ s human rights instruments must be permitted in this country.
I too believe that a partnership is premature.
That notwithstanding, visa costs should be reduced.
