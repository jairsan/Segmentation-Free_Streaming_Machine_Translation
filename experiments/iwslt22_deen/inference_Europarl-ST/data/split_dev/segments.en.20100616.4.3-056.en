Madam President, of course we need economic governance and, of course, the Member States must consolidate and restructure their budgets.
However, what we are now seeing is a radical reduction in the social budget.
Unemployment and poverty are increasing and people do not understand why banks and companies are receiving support while the politicians simply pay lip service to combating poverty and unemployment and put in place objectives that cannot be monitored.
This is why the Europe 2020 strategy and the integrated guidelines are so important.
We want to continue striving for the goal of full employment and we want proper work, not vulnerable jobs.
When it comes to combating poverty, our goals really must be more ambitious.
This is why we are calling on the Council to take up the Commission â€™ s proposal to reduce poverty in Europe by 25%.
The European Parliament has specific objectives and it is important for Parliament to be taken seriously.
