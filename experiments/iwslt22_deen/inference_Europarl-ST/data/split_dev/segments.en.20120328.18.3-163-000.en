Mr President, I would like to thank Ms Oomen-Ruijten for this report.
It demonstrates what an important role Turkey is playing with regard to the EU, not only in economic but also in political terms, as the link with Central Asia, the Arab nations and Africa.
Despite all the progress that Turkey has made in recent years, it still has a lot of catching up to do.
The main issues are the Kurdish minority and the journalists who have been imprisoned.
That has been made abundantly clear here today.
Therefore, we must make every effort to work together with the Turkish Government and the Turkish people to find solutions for the remaining problems and to support Turkey during the process of reform.
I am quite shocked at the way that many Members have called into question the fundamental rights of the European Union, including the right to freedom of religion and of expression.
Finally, I have a request for the Commission. Mr FÃ¼le, a positive agenda for Turkey must be submitted as soon as possible and we must make as much progress with it as we can.
