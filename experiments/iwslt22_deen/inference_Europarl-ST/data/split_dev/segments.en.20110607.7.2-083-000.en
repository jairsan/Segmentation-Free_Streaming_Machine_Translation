Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that there has been one major success story in this discussion, and that is the rapporteur.
I really think that, with this dossier, the rapporteur had so much resistance to overcome and that he thus managed to extract the absolute maximum possible from this entire issue.
The fact is that, in this House, there is not really a majority for a real greening of transport.
The first thing you have to do, then, is cope with that.
It is absolutely clear that there is currently a majority of transport ministers in the Council to whom environmental interests are of no concern.
It is equally clear that there is a majority in the Council who do not care about those who live and work along roadways and that there is a majority in the Council
is a majority in the Council who support consumers purchasing any old junk, that has been transported far and wide, rather than high quality regional products.
Given that situation, I would say that the very best result has been achieved.
First of all, we have the principle of external costs.
That was a major step, a difficult step, facing all that resistance.
We now have the ability, for the first time, to charge for exhaust gases.
We have the ability to charge for noise.
Of course, these are too limited and at far too low a level.
If you look at the tables, this really is a drop in the ocean.
It also proved possible to expand the corridors, so to speak, but we did not manage to put a tax on CO.
That is inexplicable.
Transport is one of the largest producers of CO emissions in Europe and it is not charged for this.
These points leave me really dissatisfied.
That said, I endorse what has been said by other Members, who believe that we need to vote in favour of this, as otherwise, everything will go down the drain.
I am voting in favour, with a heavy heart, and the thought that it is a good thing that we have come this far, but there must be much more progress in the future.
