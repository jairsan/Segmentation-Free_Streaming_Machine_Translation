. Mr President, I would like to thank all my colleagues and I am particularly pleased that we have cross-group agreement that the number of judges must be increased, as Ms Regner has also indicated how many there will eventually be.
This still has to be discussed.
The third estate is often neglected because it is unable to make its voice sufficiently heard in politics.
It is reticent by nature.
It is essentially important, however.
Mr HÃ¤fner has underlined its importance for the public at large, while Mr Karim has explained its significance for the business community.
I hope that the friendship group established by the Council will not only deal with further internal reforms of the Court of Justice of the European Union, particularly because it has already achieved a major reform that has also contributed to a drop in case numbers and concluded cases.
It is extremely important that the principle of the separation of powers should be followed here, and the system as a whole must not be overburdened.
The work on the two dossiers has shown that some questions remain outstanding and that we must take a closer look at the Court of Justice in our Committee on Legal Affairs
must take a closer look at the Court of Justice in our Committee on Legal Affairs when it comes to the issue of divergent opinions, even though these are not required by the Court, or the establishment of special chambers and technical tribunals.
A number of questions have arisen during the negotiations and need to be clarified.
We were under considerable time pressure because 14 new judges must be appointed in October and I hope that we will have concluded the negotiations on the additional new judges to be appointed before the next appointment of 13 new judges in September 2013.
Mr President, as we have saved some time because a number of colleagues have failed to attend, please permit me to present once again the various options for appointing the additional judges.
We tabled a cross-group resolution that was never adopted, despite unanimous support, because Parliament changed its Rules of Procedure in the interim.
The following proposals are on the table: Firstly, the selection takes place in strict rotation and involves all 27 Member States.
The second option: six judges are drawn from the most populous Member States, while the remaining six are drawn from the other 21 Member States in strict rotation.
Alternatively: six judges are drawn from the most populous Member States, while the remaining six are drawn from the medium-sized Member States in strict rotation.
Yet another option: six judges are drawn from the most populous Member States, while the remaining six are selected using the same system as that used to appoint advocates-general.
Another possible interim solution would be to appoint temporary judges for approximately five or six years, as suggested by the Danish Presidency of the Council.
Thus, there are plenty of solutions available, but the Council needs to agree.
