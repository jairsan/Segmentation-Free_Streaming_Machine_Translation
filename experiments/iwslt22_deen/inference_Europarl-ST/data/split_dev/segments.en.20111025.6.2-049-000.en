Madam President, Mr Dominik, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the question of discharge for the Council has been an institutional bone of contention between Parliament and the Council for years.
According to our interpretation, the process is governed by Article 319 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, which governs the discharge of the Commission ’ s budget, and the corresponding article in the Financial Regulation.
So far, the Council has not been in agreement with this view.
It presently argues that, as it uses operational funding from the Commission ’ s budget, it is also discharged along with the Commission ’ s budget.
I do not wish to repeat the statements and positions that I and the other members of the Committee on Budgetary Control have heard from the Council in this connection.
All I would say is that there have been many of them and, in my view, they have not always been coherent.
I think it is an important development that the Council is now ready to negotiate at a political level, rather than at the level of the Secretaries-General – who I do not believe have sufficient political mandate for this – as it informed us by means of a letter following the Committee on Budgetary Control ’ s decision on the granting of discharge to the Council.
I would like to express my sincere thanks to the Presidency of the Council for this new offer.
I take the view that we should take up this offer of negotiations with the highest-ranking negotiating delegation we can muster.
I also believe that we should not go into the negotiations with predetermined ideas.
I therefore recommended to my group that we should abstain at this point.
