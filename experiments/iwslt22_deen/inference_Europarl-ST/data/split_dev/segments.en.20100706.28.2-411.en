Madam President, we need more supervision of the financial markets in Europe too.
The economic and financial crisis has made it glaringly and painfully obvious that opportunities were missed in the past.
The European Financial Supervisory Authorities must be provided with extensive powers. They must not degenerate into empty shells which passively observe market developments.
Particularly for financial institutions operating across borders, a central body is required which can join forces with the national supervisory bodies at the crucial time and provide rapid, targeted intervention.
Direct intervention rights are imperative where there are differences between national authorities at times of emergencies and also where there are infringements of Community law.
The Council must finally accept the European Parliament as a legislator of equal standing.
There has certainly been no lack of preparatory work by the responsible MEPs.
Numerous discussions have taken place and work has been carried out in Parliament quickly and purposefully.
We are now waiting for the Council to provide clear answers and concrete proposals in writing.
I feel that a reference to the FIFA World Cup lends itself at the moment to describe the situation: the ball is now in the Council â€™ s half.
