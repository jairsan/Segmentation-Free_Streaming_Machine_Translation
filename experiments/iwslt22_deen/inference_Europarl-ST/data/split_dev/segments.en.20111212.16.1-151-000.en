Mr President, Commissioner, we are all aware that many Member States are threatened with a shortage of labour in the future, and a shortage of skilled labour in particular.
I believe that with this directive we have succeeded, on the one hand, in creating certain incentives for those who are actually needed in the Member States and will
therefore be able to find work, while, on the other hand, maintaining checks and thus managing legal admissions.
I consider it particularly important that we incorporate a ruling that establishes that naturally it remains up to the Member States to set quotas, and that then – once such quotas are in place and if they are
and if they are being or have been used up – a decision of inadmissibility may be made; in other words, the Member State can then refuse immigration.
In the final event, these are regulations that are intended to lead to a clear decision being made within four months as to whether or not a third-country national may migrate to a particular place within the Union.
This will kill two birds with one stone: labour will be found and come here by legal means, while at the same time we combat illegality.
