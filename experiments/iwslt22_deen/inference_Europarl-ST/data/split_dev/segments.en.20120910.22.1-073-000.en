Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to thank Ms Auconie, who worked very hard in this area.
Given the differing views held, it was no easy job in committee, and it is certainly no secret that there were different focuses even within the group.
This is, however, a good basis for the negotiations with the Council.
For us, it is important that consumer protection has top priority.
We have learnt the lessons of the BSE crisis.
At the same time, however, we have made it clear to our farmers that we need to pay closer attention, when it comes to imports, too, to ensuring that rules that we put in place together are also complied with.
We do not want any unnecessary bureaucracy.
The trick now lies in finding out the point at which we have the maximum possible level of consumer protection without causing unnecessary bureaucracy.
After intensive discussions within the group, we therefore introduced another refinement of Article 1 point 14 that envisages that the information that has thus far fallen within the scope of voluntary labelling under this system could soon be covered by food labelling rules.
However, we also want to see that monitored.
Mr Schnellhardt asked the Commission the right question, namely, how can we ensure that there will be no deception of consumers?
Our point of view is that the competent authorities must monitor this and that penalties must also be imposed in the event of violations.
After the vote tomorrow, we will be entering into negotiations with the Council.
All sides will have to be flexible so that we can achieve our common goal.
Perhaps there will also still be new insights during the negotiations with the Council that we could then also allow to flow through into the final result.
