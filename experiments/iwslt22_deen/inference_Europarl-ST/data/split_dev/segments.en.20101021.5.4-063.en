. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I would like to congratulate Mrs Meissner on her report and thank her for all her hard work.
We share the approach taken by this report which puts the focus not on the sectoral structure of maritime policy in the individual Member States, but instead emphasises the importance of coordinating maritime policy within and across the Member States.
If we look to the future, we will see the space available in our seas and oceans becoming more restricted.
The oceans are transport routes, sources of raw materials and energy, suppliers of foodstuffs and water reservoirs.
The economic exploitation of the oceans is growing and this brings an accompanying increase in the environmental impact on them.
Conflicts of interest will arise and we will have to resolve them by means of effective coordination within and among countries.
It is not possible to comment on every issue, but I would like to mention briefly the sulphur emission control areas.
It was not my intention to make the limits less strict.
When the Commission presents its study, we will be able to tell to what extent the limits will result in a shift from sea to road transport, in particular in the North Sea and the Baltic.
Then we can discuss this issue further.
However, the basic conditions for competition within the European Union between the North and the South must remain at the same level.
This must also be one of the Commission â€™ s objectives.
There is one point which we are not entirely happy about.
We have been talking for a long time about the strategic importance of the shipbuilding industry in Europe.
We have also said that innovation is very important in this industry, because this is the only way that it can survive.
We need a coordinated strategy for our policy on the shipbuilding industry.
I believe that the call from the Member States to put funding aside for shipbuilding was also very important, but it has not been supported by the Liberals and the Conservatives.
Ladies and gentlemen, how do you propose that we should support the shipbuilding industry in Europe?
Coming out with platitudes and good wishes for the workers in the European shipyards, who are concerned about their jobs, is simply not enough.
We Social Democrats expect better measures and better proposals in this area.
