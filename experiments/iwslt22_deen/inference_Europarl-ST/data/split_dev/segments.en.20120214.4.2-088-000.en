Mr President, Commissioner Barnier, as rapporteur for the Services Directive, I did ensure, at that time, that services of common economic interest and services of general interest were excluded from the scope of that directive.
At the same time I said that it is absolutely necessary for these services to be regulated at European level in order to protect them.
Since then, we have seen the advent of the Treaty of Lisbon and its supplementary Protocol No 26, which gives the Commission a duty.
Commission President Barroso promised us that he would act in this regard and we await real and substantial action from the Commission in this area.
My question for you, Commissioner, is: when can we expect a legislative text from you?
This is something that is needed, in my opinion.
It is needed not because we want to regulate these services, but because we want to ensure that these services continue to remain in the hands of the competent people and bodies in the Member States, and with the highest possible level of quality.
