Madam President, Mr Orb√°n, it is true that your country has suffered a great deal and that your country, you yourself and your party have made a major contribution to peace and to a united Europe.
As a good neighbour and as an Austrian, I would like to make this clear with genuine respect in what is an historic hour for you.
Creating jobs, promoting growth and increasing security are the priorities of your Presidency and we are happy to support them.
Other priorities include strengthening the internal market, making progress on energy policy, the Danube strategy and concluding the negotiations with Croatia.
These are all areas where we want to and intend to support you.
I would like to thank you specifically for your defence of freedom of religion.
Christianity is one of the cornerstones of European action and European thought and we very much respect the fact that you have reformed the communist media legislation in Hungary which dates back to 1986.
This is important and it is also the right thing to do. We think that many of the opinions which we have heard in this context, including in this House, are wrong.
A number of the voices remind me of the sanctions which were unjustly imposed on the Austrian Government in 2000.
I think that you are being treated just as unfairly now as the Austrian Government was then.
I would like to thank you for what you have done and wish the new Hungarian Presidency every success.
