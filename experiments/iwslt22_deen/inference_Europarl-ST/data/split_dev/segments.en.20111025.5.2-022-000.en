Madam President, the Heads of State or Government clearly wanted to pre-empt our critical demands here today.
At the summit on Sunday, they stressed that they were very much minded to carry out an ambitious European Semester.
There was also much talk of learning from the past.
The first findings from the current European Semester are sobering, in my view.
They confirm the experiences that we, the European Parliament, have had to face in applying the Stability and Growth Pact that has been in place hitherto.
Self-monitoring by the Council is not working.
It has not worked so far and it never will.
Hence, the time is now ripe to move from sweeping lip service in public to useful preventive budgetary policy and coordination and, indeed, for that to be put into writing.
In the end, we come back to the same conclusion – we must not rest on our laurels when it comes to strengthening the Stability and Growth Pact.
The Community method needs to be further strengthened – there is no doubt about it.
We parliamentarians should insist on more transparency and on a public discourse for the annual growth report, for the Commission recommendations and for use by the Member States.
The great hope, however, remains with the Commission, and quite rightly so.
I therefore urge that we should exhaust our full potential for improvement together, as simply creating a new instrument does not get us anywhere – it also needs to be used efficiently.
