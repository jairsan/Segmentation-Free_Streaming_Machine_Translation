Mr President, thank you for your statement, Commissioner.
I should like to approach it somewhat differently.
Yes, naturally there are substantial gaps in European company law that need to be closed.
It is necessary to close them.
However, the short-term thinking behind the shareholder concept is one of the main causes of the crisis.
The economic and financial crisis has shown us very clearly that this policy has failed.
An enterprise must be seen as a social organisation that has responsibilities to shareholders, employees, creditors and society as a whole.
Consequently, information, consultation and codetermination are essential if the social responsibility of enterprises is to be more than just lip service.
In any event, the competition between national and European legal forms must be ended.
You mentioned the 14th directive, Commissioner.
As rapporteur for the recent resolution on the 14th directive, I am disappointed at the inadequate follow-up from the Commission.
Making reference to the impact assessment carried out by the old European Commission in 2007 is not sufficient.
I call on you to take specific measures and to stick to the procedure agreed between the Commission and Parliament.
I should like to state firmly that the work on the European private company was taken up too early, has not been fully thought out by the Commission, and does not take into account the current requirements of the people of Europe.
If we are to achieve our objective of sustainable European company law, what we need instead is a European framework instrument for worker participation.
The resolution from the Committee on Legal Affairs tells you to pursue a stronger stakeholder approach in all your future initiatives, in order to safeguard the interests of workers, creditors and members, and to comply with national regulations on protection and codetermination.
