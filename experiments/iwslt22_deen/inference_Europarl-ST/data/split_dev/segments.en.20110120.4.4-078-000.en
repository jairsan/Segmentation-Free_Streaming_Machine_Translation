Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Gahler, and all the shadow rapporteurs.
It is quite true to say that Europe needs to adapt continuously to new realities and to deal with changes in the balance of political power.
In relation to Arctic policy, this means: we must understand that the Arctic states wish to develop the region themselves, but that they are open to cooperation.
They are not interested in new treaties, but want to see existing regulatory treaties being developed further.
Climate change and new shipping routes do not solely entail risks, but can also offer opportunities.
In relation to the Arctic, this means the EU has an opportunity for greater cooperation and development.
After all, no one can combat the effects of climate change on their own, just as no one can develop the potential of the Arctic region on their own.
In addition, the European Union has a sustained interest in the safe development â€¦
