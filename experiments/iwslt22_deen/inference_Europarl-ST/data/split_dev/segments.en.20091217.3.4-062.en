Mr President, all or at least the majority of the speakers are talking about the European social model, but this is not reflected sufficiently in the EU budget or in the cohesion policy.
Therefore, I would like to see an independent European Social Fund (ESF) which is separate from the European structural policy.
More funding should be allocated to the ESF and it should become more flexible.
It should also be possible to increase the funding available during the seven-year finance period.
By separating the social fund from structural policy, it will be possible to make sufficient funding available to those regions which are not economically underdeveloped and have therefore largely been ignored by EU structural fund policy.
The European Social Fund should therefore be used more effectively to combat problems on the labour market, such as high levels of unemployment, low employment rates for women, large numbers of early school leavers and low levels of further education.
