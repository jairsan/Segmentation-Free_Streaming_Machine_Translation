Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the crisis goes on.
The measures adopted in recent months, or even years, have failed to convince the markets on a durable basis.
There is an urgent need for the Member States to take seriously a disciplined, balanced budgetary policy.
The ‘ two-pack ’ can help to make progress in that direction.
It can provide the basis for stability and growth.
However, a whole series of amendments are once again being tabled, with the aim of watering down the proposals.
We do not need a watered-down ‘ two-pack ’, however. What we do require is a genuine act of release.
This act of release could consist of two elements. The first element would be the debt redemption fund already mentioned by a number of speakers, which would help to consolidate the inherited debts and spread them out over a period of 25 years.
The second element would be that we have to achieve real progress in the conversion of the euro area into a true internal financial market, in other words, into an internal market with cross-border banking supervision, a cross-border deposit guarantee fund and a uniform cross-border banking rescue and resolution regime.
