Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in this year ’ s enlargement strategy, the Commission has defined the key issues very accurately.
Our rapporteur has reiterated them very effectively.
It is about the credibility of our policies, honesty towards the EU ’ s citizens and the citizens of the candidate countries, and clarity on the criteria
on the criteria, which must be fulfilled prior to accession. We cannot pursue policies which bypass public opinion in the EU Member States.
Public opinion in many countries is sceptical towards further rounds of enlargement.
It is therefore the task of policy-makers – not only the task of the Commission but our task too – to bring clarity to the accession process and to explain it more effectively at home.
Any country which successfully completes the accession negotiations will have progressed through a lengthy reform process and will have incorporated many of our legal provisions into its system of governance.
An improved enlargement process does not mean offering a firm timetable but creating more clarity for the steps along the road towards accession.
That is why we must send out a clear signal.
Firstly, we want to keep the EU ’ s door open to the European countries because an enlarged EU offers all of us security, democracy and prosperity.
Secondly, any country embarking on the road towards accession should be able to count on support from all of us.
Thirdly, however, the pace of progress towards accession will ultimately depend on how quickly the accession criteria can be fulfilled and implemented.
We know from experience that ‘ rebates ’ are not helpful here.
Let me give some advice to my German colleagues in the House and at home: we Germans should not always act as if we were expecting to have to pick up the tab at the end of the process! We have profited to such an extent from previous enlargements that I feel sure that we can look forward to the next stage in a calm and confident manner!
