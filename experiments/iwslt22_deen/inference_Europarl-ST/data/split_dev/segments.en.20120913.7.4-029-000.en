Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, would like to offer my sincere thanks to Ms Geringer de Oedenberg for the results of her negotiations with the Council.
I know that it was difficult to also get the numerous good ideas that we had in Parliament through the tough negotiations with the Council.
Certainly, with the directive, we have now found a viable route to granting works of literature orphan work status and preserving this cultural heritage for the future while making it accessible.
However, I do still have some minor doubts about whether we have really found an efficient solution for audiovisual works.
Across the EU, a cultural asset has accumulated in the archives, especially of broadcasters after 1945, that is of inestimable value.
Preserving this cultural heritage for the future, too, poses an enormous challenge on both a technical and financial level.
The number of rights holders for audiovisual works is frequently higher than for written works.
The diligent search that, under the directive, will also be necessary for audiovisual works takes a form that is therefore intensive in terms of costs, time and personnel.
There is a great cultural policy interest in preserving our audiovisual heritage, especially in this Internet age.
We now need to carefully observe whether we have succeeded, through this directive, in noticeably reducing the number of audiovisual works in the European Union that are unusable in practical situations due to the rights being unclear.
The review clause offers us a good opportunity here.
In any case, we need to prevent audiovisual material in the archives going to waste as unrecoverable because it proves too costly to clear up who holds the rights.
It goes without saying that, for orphan works, too, rights holders must be given reasonable remuneration.
The involvement of collecting societies and other rights declaration systems here could help to remove uncertainties about rights, allow originators to come into their own, and thus also to release cultural treasures.
I would have liked to have seen a little greater progress at this juncture, but the first step has been taken, and I believe we will work on this further over the forthcoming years.
