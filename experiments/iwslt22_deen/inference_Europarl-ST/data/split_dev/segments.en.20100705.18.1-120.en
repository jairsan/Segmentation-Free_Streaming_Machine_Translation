Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased that we will be able to adopt this report with a large majority tomorrow.
There are two things that I regard as being particularly important.
The first is ensuring that the objectives we have set ourselves for 2020 can be measured.
We need measurable principles which will allow us to take stock after ten years or, even better, halfway through the period, so that we can identify whether we have achieved some of what we set out to do or whether things have not worked out and we need to make improvements.
This applies in particular to CO emissions in the transport sector.
If all the other sectors are making good progress, as Mr Cramer has said, then we can rightly call on the transport industry to do the same.
European transport policy is of particular importance when it comes to reducing CO emissions.
The second point concerns the implementation of efficient comodality.
For me, this is the key to a sensible EU transport strategy.
I say this, because efficient comodality can have a number of different meanings.
If we do not base this theoretical concept on the right criteria, which can be put into practice, we will not achieve our objective.
Therefore, I am once again calling on the Commission to ensure that the concept is implemented correctly down to the last detail, which means developing useful intermodal nodes and removing the bottlenecks in the transport of goods to and from important European trade gateways.
This particularly applies to the links between major ports and airports and their hinterlands.
My third point is that the proposed core Trans-European Network (TEN) must be based on the same criteria, so that there is an almost automatic modal shift towards an efficient and environmentally friendly European transport system.
These are the factors that make up a sensible plan. Not just cost effectiveness, but also social compatibility, environmental protection and sustainability.
Mr Grosch and Mrs Alvarez, thank you very much for all your hard work.
