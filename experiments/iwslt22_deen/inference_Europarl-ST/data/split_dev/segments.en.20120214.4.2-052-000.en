Mr President, my question is for Commissioner Andor.
As you know, my group has for quite some time been calling for the Posting of Workers Directive to be revised, and I find it very regrettable that the Commission has thus far not done so.
It is not as if there is a shortage of reasons to do so: we have social dumping on a massive scale and the principle of equal treatment applies to too few criteria.
Furthermore, there is often abuse of posted workers by means of failure to adhere to the rules.
What we need is limits on subcontractor chains and more opportunities for information for workers.
I therefore await the Commission â€™ s proposals on the posting of workers package with baited breath.
My question is this: how does the Commission proposal for the Enforcement Directive seek to tackle the problems with the Posting of Workers Directive that I have outlined?
Most importantly, are there measures in the proposal to prevent the well-known problem of social dumping?
