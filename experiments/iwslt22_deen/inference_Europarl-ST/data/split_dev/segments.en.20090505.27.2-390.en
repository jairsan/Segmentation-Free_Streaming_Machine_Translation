Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Rehn, during this sixth legislative period Turkey has been a priority on our EU agenda.
Before the start of accession negotiations, Turkey had made huge steps towards reform and the EU recognised this accordingly.
Today the mood has changed somewhat.
We are growing increasingly concerned about the progress of the democratisation process in Turkey.
Freedom of the press, the protection of minorities, but also reform of the judiciary must be monitored constantly.
As for the Ergenekon trial which is taking place in Turkey, I would like to say that this must not become politicised.
The fact is that arrests and searches are taking place.
Hasty comments should be avoided.
Careful reporting has an important role to play here.
Important progress has been made on the Kurdish question.
The solution of the Kurdish problem is central to the process of democratisation and the protection of minorities.
However, I also have concerns about the current position of some EU heads of government.
Ambiguous signals from the EU also mean that from time to time the democratic process in Turkey faces a bumpy ride.
In this respect I would like to recall that a clear commitment on behalf of the EU to Turkey ’ s full membership would give the reform process a huge boost.
Otherwise, there will always be new breeding grounds for fundamentalism and nationalism, and the Kurdish problem will get worse.
After all, the common goal is to turn Turkey into a more modern, stable and prosperous democracy, based on a secular state and a pluralistic society.
This is not only in Turkey ’ s interest, it is also an important strategic interest of the European Union.
