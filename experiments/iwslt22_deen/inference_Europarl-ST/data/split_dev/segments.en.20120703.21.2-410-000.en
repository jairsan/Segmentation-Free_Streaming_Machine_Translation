Madam President, Mr De Gucht, first of all, the purpose of the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) is a good one and involves establishing international standards to combat breaches of copyright and product piracy.
However, ACTA is a prime example of how we should not be dealing with the justified concerns of citizens, in other words, with a lack of transparency that has to be seen to be believed.
There are many serious reservations about ACTA. The Committee on Legal Affairs has taken these reservations into account and has made clear its opposition to ACTA.
The intention of the agreement is to intervene in data protection and, therefore, in the right to informational self-determination.
The agreement is too vague and, as a result, I am concerned that it may be implemented differently in the relevant states, which will be to the detriment of our citizens.
I am opposed to Internet service providers being able to monitor citizens and, under certain circumstances, actually doing so.
I am concerned that the necessary renewal of copyright in Europe will be restricted and forestalled under pressure from the industry.
This is why we must say a clear ‘ No ’ to ACTA tomorrow.
