Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in the past week, I had the honour of speaking about the 20th anniversary of the completion of the internal market at a Franco-German partnership celebration.
It was interesting to see how the guests reacted to this.
They took it all for granted, and indeed it is good that citizens consider this something that goes without saying.
The four fundamental freedoms are the core of the European Union, and I hope that we, as Parliament, will fight all joint attempts to erect new barriers and new borders, such as
such as when the German Government and the former French Government attempted to erect new barriers, because the freedom of movement of our citizens is at least as important to us as the freedom of movement of capital or goods.
In my view, Mr Busuttil has presented a good and helpful report.
The internal market scoreboard, SOLVIT and other instruments are useful for establishing whether the governments really want European laws and whether the deficits are actually being reduced, as the Council has in fact agreed.
We want the internal market to be simplified for consumers.
We want SMEs to have easier access and we want all our citizens to profit from it.
Interestingly, transposition is not always related to the size of the country.
As has already been mentioned, Malta comes out best; Belgium, unfortunately, has not done so well.
Mr Busuttil, your motion is also interesting and I have great sympathy for you, but I must point out that there are a few other demands in your report that
already incorporate this, such as Article 18 on transparency, or Article 24, in which we call for correlation tables, or even Article 21, which suggests that the European Court of Justice could work more quickly.
So perhaps we should work on this first.
On behalf of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, I should like to highlight four further aspects.
Firstly, the transposition must be correct; that is, it does not have to be gold-plated, but it must not be lax and inadequate.
Mr Chatzimarkakis, if I may have your ear for a moment: the two liberal camps in the national German Government are currently dabbling with the Payment Services Directive, and from what I have heard, initial reports are not encouraging.
Now for my second point, which is that the internal market is also a way of overcoming the crisis, creates jobs and contributes to growth.
Thirdly, we consider the procedures for the social protection of workers to be too cumbersome, because as far as we are concerned – and this is my only criticism, Commissioner Barnier – social cohesion is dealt with too briefly in this report.
We will insist on this, because we have a long tradition of social cohesion.
Finally, I would like to quote your former colleague, Jacques Delors, who said that the internal market works according to three principles: competition which stimulates, cooperation which strengthens and solidarity which unites.
