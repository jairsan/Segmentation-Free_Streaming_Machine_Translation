Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I very much welcome the fact that we are having a timely political debate on the basis of initiative reports which will allow us to use our instrument of solidarity in a more targeted and efficient way by 2014 at the latest.
It is also very important to me to inform the citizens of Europe about the European added value that this will offer.
Therefore, it is logical for us to reject all attempts to renationalise the structural policy.
More than ever we need a standard Community policy which is able to meet the challenges we are currently facing, such as globalisation, climate change and demographic change.
Whether we have been successful or whether we are deluding ourselves with the budgetary commitment for the Lisbon Strategy will hopefully become clear at the latest when the required analysis has been carried out.
We have come to a fork in the road where we must decide whether or not territorial cohesion and true sustainable development are the symbols of European policy.
In order to make this decision we need a large number of partners, in particular cities.
For this reason, we also want to see global grants going directly to these partners, not only on paper, but also in practice.
However much we value subsidiarity, European funds must be allocated on the basis of binding criteria.
Alongside the importance of the urban dimension, these must include an integrated approach and the implementation of our climate objectives.
We have already come to a consensus on this. Unfortunately, this was not the case in the vote of the Committee on Regional Development. One other thought: according to the Commission â€™ s Economic Recovery Plan, the allocation of Structural Funds should be simplified and accelerated.
It is not yet clear to me why we needed a crisis in order for this to happen, but it is a hopeful sign.
If the comprehensive analysis of the best practice projects really forms part of the political discussion, there should be no further obstacles to Europe playing a pioneering role in the development of a truly sustainable policy.
I would like to thank all the rapporteurs for their hard work.
