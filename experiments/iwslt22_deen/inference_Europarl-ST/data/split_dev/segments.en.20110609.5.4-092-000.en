Mr Jadot, can you confirm that the joint resolution which we have drawn up on the subject of stress tests was initially
was initially signed by the chairs of your group, Mrs Harms and Mr Cohn-Bendit, who then opposed it in plenary, despite the fact that no major changes had been made?
Do you also believe that this was not very helpful to Mr Oettinger who is committed to introducing more stringent stress tests?
