Mr President, Mr Andor, you did not answer my question.
Is it true that this document states that the right to strike and the accompanying strike actions or similar threats must be proportional to the economic freedom to provide services?
Is this what this document says or not?
My final question on this subject is: do you believe that Parliament will vote in favour of a regulation of this kind?
I am working on the assumption that Parliament will reject it.
