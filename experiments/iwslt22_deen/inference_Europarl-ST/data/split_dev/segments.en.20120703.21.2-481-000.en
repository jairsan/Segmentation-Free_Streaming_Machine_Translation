Mr President, we must get rid of ACTA and I am pleased that the debate here in Parliament is moving in precisely this direction.
ACTA is an attack on fundamental rights, such as the protection of privacy, freedom of information and communication and the right to informational self-determination.
It is the whole host of vague legal terms which have opened the door to this.
We are faced with the threat that legal protection and legal procedures will no longer be available.
We are right to be concerned that providers will be forced to monitor the Internet, put web blocks in place and filter content.
Ultimately, this could lead to law enforcement being privatised and the providers being turned into deputy sheriffs.
The protection of individuals ’ copyright must not, under any circumstances, lead to the freedom of information and communication being undermined.
It is true that we need a modern copyright law which has a sensible balance between the interests of the originators and of the users.
I would like the Commission finally to submit a proposal for this.
ACTA will not help in this respect at all. Instead, it is forcing us to move in a very specific direction. This is why we must say ‘ No ’ to ACTA tomorrow.
