Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Treaty of Lisbon, on which work went on for so long, had two clear messages: firstly, the strengthening of the Community method with a central role for the Commission and, secondly, the strengthening of democracy with the participation of the European Parliament.
Little more than a year after the entry into force of the Treaty, the spirit of Lisbon is already being ignored and ridden roughshod over.
What the European Council has devised with this revision of the Treaty is unequivocally contrary to both of these messages of the Treaty of Lisbon.
The Community method is not being strengthened â€“ instead, what we have is renationalisation, intergovernmentalisation, in an important area of future EU policy and the complete exclusion of the bodies of the EU.
That is unacceptable and Parliament actually has to be opposed to this proposal.
It amazes me that the Commission, as guardian of the Treaties, has not spoken up more clearly and that we here in Parliament have to act, to some extent, as representatives of the Commission.
We must push the Commission into action that it should already have taken.
A dangerous precedent is being set here. We are observing as a result of the economic crisis that monetary union cannot exist alone.
Given the influx of refugees from North Africa and the uncertainty in our neighbourhood, we are seeking additional EU policies and we do not want renationalisation.
I hope that the rapporteurs can still make improvements as otherwise, I cannot vote in favour of this revision of the Treaty.
