Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, yesterday, the Foreign Minister of the Federal Republic of Germany told the United Nations that the defence of Israel â€™ s security was part of state policy for the Federal Republic of Germany.
I would like to express my support for this on both political and moral grounds.
However, this stance on the defence of Israeli security does not mean that we can stay silent in relation to injustices originating in Israel.
What we are witnessing in the building of settlements is a continuous violation of the dignity of the Palestinians, because they are being deprived of what belongs to them.
Madam Vice-President, I hold your work in high esteem and I wish expressly to praise you in this regard.
However, when we now hear that Israel intends building 1 100 new homes on the other side of the Green Line in Jerusalem, then a statement of regret is not sufficient. Instead, we must say that in this particular situation, such a move constitutes a provocation and must be condemned.
In the end, Israel will achieve exactly what it does not want, namely, a unilateral recognition of Palestine.
I would prefer to see a solution that derives from negotiations.
However, if Israel continues to behave as it does at present, then we will see a unilateral recognition of Palestine.
I must state that the Palestinians have the right to live in dignity and their dignity must be expressed in a state that is recognised by the international community.
Both Israel and Palestine must live together in partnership, each with their own secure borders.
We must, once and for all, stop vacillating in our response to the continued building of settlements. We must criticise and condemn such moves.
