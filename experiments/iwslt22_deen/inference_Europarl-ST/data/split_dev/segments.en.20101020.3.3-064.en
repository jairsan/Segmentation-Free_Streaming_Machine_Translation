Mr President, without wishing to appear presumptuous, listening to the debate here this morning, I think we can conclude that some amount of work has been done in recent months.
The Special Committee on the Financial, Economic and Social Crisis has also completed a great deal of work in the past year.
That is apparent from the 1 600 amendments to the original draft report that have been tabled.
The Committee has now been extended by a further year.
In my view, this is quite correct.
The crisis is far from at an end.
Ireland has only just escaped bankruptcy, the state budget in Greece is certainly not yet back in good shape and the overall situation gives no reason to sound the all clear.
The financial and economic reforms must therefore continue and it is too early yet to bring to a close the debate on the causes of the crisis and the conclusions that must be drawn.
It would therefore be incorrect to declare the work of the Crisis Committee more or less done and to end its mandate.
Instead, we must carry out further work based on what has been achieved to date.
That is why I feel that the interim report that has been tabled is acceptable to all.
This is also demonstrated by the broad approval it has enjoyed in the Crisis Committee.
Certainly, the text could have been worded somewhat more concisely and succinctly at some points, but we should see the report for what it is – an interim answer.
What is much more important than the wording of individual passages is that in the second half of the Committee ’ s work, we build on the preliminary work that we have done.
We need to consider how and where the discussions of the Crisis Committee can be supported in the forthcoming debates by the legislative committees.
