− Madam President, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs welcomes targets and measures that help slow down climate change and mitigate its effects.
I shall confine myself here to one social policy aspect: the prosperity of the so-called First World, over-production and excessive
consumption – especially transport with massive use of fossil fuels – are the main causes of the increase in climate-damaging greenhouse gases.
On the other hand, it is the socially weakest and the poor who are most affected by the consequences of the climate disaster waiting in the wings.
They do not have the means to adapt.
Energy and food prices hit them much, much harder than they do the rich.
Famines which already exist will worsen drastically.
We therefore need a global offence against hunger in the world.
Our demand is for the burden of reducing greenhouse gas emissions to be divided in a socially acceptable manner.
