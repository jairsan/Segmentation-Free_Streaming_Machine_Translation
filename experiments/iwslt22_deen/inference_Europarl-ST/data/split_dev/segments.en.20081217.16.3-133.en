Mr President, I find it particularly regrettable that, despite broad support by Members, my own-initiative motion on keeping Sunday as the non-working day has not been included in the vote in this House.
Europe is based on Christian values: the protection of the family is of particular concern to us, and Sunday is the special day for practising these values.
This Directive would have been exactly the right place to give Sunday a real footing as the non-working day throughout Europe, and that is why I find this regrettable.
Secondly, I wish to say that I rejected the Council â€™ s positions on the Working Time Directive as working hours would have been extended
on-call time discounted as working time, and also the European rules would have been undermined by a whole host of opt-outs.
I am pleased that Parliament has managed to secure negotiations with the Council.
