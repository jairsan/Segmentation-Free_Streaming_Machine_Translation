Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to highlight two points.
You probably cannot tell this from looking at me, but I am not a fan of punk music.
We are now all familiar with one punk group and that is Pussy Riot.
I see the situation slightly differently from Baroness Ashton, but the subject of whether this was a civil protest or simply hooliganism which caused deep offence to other people is open to discussion.
We can perhaps even discuss what the penalty for this sort of behaviour should be.
We all agree that a two-year sentence is far too long.
However, what should concern us and, most importantly, what should concern the Russians in their own country is the clear indication that this trial is once again an example of the political system exerting influence on the judicial system.
That is totally unacceptable. My second point concerns the NGO act, which, as has already been said, has deliberately vague wording so that it can be interpreted as required.
We need to set clear boundaries.
The best thing to do would be to put this act where it belongs, in other words, in the rubbish bin.
However, ladies and gentlemen, there is one thing you cannot say to me, which is that we must now evaluate everything we do together with Russia.
I am firmly convinced, and we discussed this 10 days ago with our Russian colleagues in St Petersburg, that the only sensible way forward is to continue to talk to them and to Russian civil society, in order to get things moving.
I am not one of those who believe that a discussion of resolutions by less than 3% of the Members of the European Parliament has better prospects for success.
