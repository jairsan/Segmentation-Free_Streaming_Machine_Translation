Mr President, very many measures have been adopted under the guise of combating terrorism in recent years, including by the Council.
However, very many of these measures are not reasonably proportionate to the actual threat posed by terrorism.
On the contrary, they have resulted in unacceptable restrictions of citizens rights.
The systematic exchange of data, unrelated to any grounds for suspicion, provided for in the SWIFT agreement is clearly no exception to this.
Even the German Federal Criminal Police Office, which is not really known as a data protection group, had to admit the disproportionate nature of this measure.
We must put a stop to these permanent restrictions of citizens ’ rights and we must not approve the provisional agreement. With regard to the Council ’ s methods, I would once again like to say quite clearly that the US examined and stored the data of SWIFT users without any form of restriction at all.
However, the Council did not sanction this procedure, it legalised it! I would, of course, also like to urge the Council to pass on all of the information relating to this matter to the European Parliament.
