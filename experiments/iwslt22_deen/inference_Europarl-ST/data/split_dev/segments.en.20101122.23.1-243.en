Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, at an international level, the Member States of the European Union have undertaken to make a significant contribution to civil and military crisis management capabilities throughout the world.
However, in many cases, we simply pay lip-service to this undertaking, which is formulated several times in the Helsinki Headline Goal as well as elsewhere.
Let me put it in black and white: 25% of the positions approved by the Member States for the European Union ’ s currently active civil missions, such as EULEX or EUPOL, are unfilled.
The objectives and structures for the civil and military capabilities of the European Union repeatedly formulated by the Member States could hardly be further from reality.
That is why the European Parliament has decided to produce an own-initiative report on the development of civil and military structures and coordination in the European Union.
Specifically: Parliament once again states in this report that the particular civil and military capabilities of the European Union are one of the most important instruments in its foreign policy and common security and defence policy.
We have taken an unusual route in facing up to Parliament ’ s responsibilities in the context of the Lisbon process.
We did not start with a report, but instead began by creating the empirical basis for this report.
We have formulated very specific proposals based on these figures, which is why we have the support of the broad majority of the Committee on Foreign Affairs: on a strategic level, we have made concrete proposals for the establishment of a structure of equal partnership
establishment of a structure of equal partnership between the military and civilian arms of the new European External Action Service; while, on an operative level, we have resolved to establish a permanent European
to be staffed with personnel by the Member States, to deal with the issue of creating an attractive system of incentives for national experts to participate in such operations and the build-up of personnel reserves for the future.
We have made specific proposals for the training of civil and military personnel.
There are concrete proposals for how start-up missions are to be financed, for example, the establishment of a start-up fund according to Article 41 of the treaty.
Proposals are on the table for the instruments of crisis management, in particular, the question of greater future cooperation between police and military forces.
One example of this is the European policing troop. However, the question arises as to how these two instruments can be linked together in specific operational cases and how we can manage the issue of separating purely military and civil operations.
We have made proposals for the future of the battle groups.
We are calling for a new approach to this issue.
We want to see the battle groups being financed in accordance with the Athena mechanism.
We are calling for the further development of the capabilities of the battle groups in line with the Oslo directives, the strengthening of the ability of the battle groups to secure civil missions, and a widening of the definition of the missions of the battle groups.
We are considering the issue of research and technology, the question of dual use, and the inclusion of civil and military missions in the security research programme as part of the European Union ’ s research programme.
We are dealing with concrete questions in relation to equipment and stockpiling, as well as international cooperation with the United Nations and NATO.
Our main concern here is the avoidance of duplication, the improved use of existing structures, the question of the consolidation of shared air transport capacities and the question of the implementation of the Berlin Plus Agreements for improved cooperation between the two organisations in the event of a crisis.
In other words, Parliament has lived up to its new tasks and obligations.
The report was supported by a broad majority from all groups in the Committee on Foreign Affairs and we see it as an important contribution to the future establishment of civil and military structures in the European Union.
