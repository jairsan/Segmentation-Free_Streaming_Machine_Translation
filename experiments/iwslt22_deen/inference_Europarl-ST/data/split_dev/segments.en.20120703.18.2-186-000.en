Mr President, I am convinced that in creating a single European railway area, we will achieve the following: firstly, a better service for customers; secondly, optimal utilisation of the European corridors; and thirdly, an increase in the competitiveness of the railways.
To do this, however, we need a strong regulatory authority that ensures greater competition and makes decisions swiftly.
To achieve that, we need to open up the market for national passenger rail transport, and for that we need, above all, technical harmonisation in the areas of power supply, safety equipment and track gauges.
On the whole, this is a very positive report that I am happy to support.
