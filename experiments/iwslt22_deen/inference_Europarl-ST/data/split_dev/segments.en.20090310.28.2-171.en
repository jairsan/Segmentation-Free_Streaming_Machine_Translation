Mr President, I am in favour of a common asylum policy for the European Union that would lead to quick and certain decisions.
said, I am against this report, as it contains elements that are absolutely unacceptable, such as the broadening of the term refugee way beyond what the Geneva Convention currently
states; rejecting the regulation of safe third countries that we had already managed to reach a positive agreement on; giving Frontex tasks that have absolutely nothing to do with it;
asylum seekers a free choice of which country is to be responsible for the procedure â€“ which represents the abandonment of the Dublin Convention; and easier access to the labour market for asylum seekers.
We want quick procedures and not the integration of asylum seekers who will possibly have to leave the European Union again after 14 days because they will not be granted refugee status anyway.
Overall, the development in the Union is heading in the positive direction of a common policy, but what has been proposed in this report is completely counterproductive.
It is for that reason that I voted against the report.
