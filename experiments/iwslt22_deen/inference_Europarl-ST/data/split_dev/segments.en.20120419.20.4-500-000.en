Mr Jahr, do you agree with me that the criteria system that the Commission has now established for supporting less-favoured areas has turned the whole business on its head?
You yourself – if I have read this correctly – are a young farmer operating in the crisis-hit region of Mecklenburg and have gained your first experience there.
This is just pasture land with only 20 soil points and a situation that means it can truly be classed as a less-favoured area.
I would therefore like to ask you: what impact do you think this will actually have on our farmers in particular in the less-favoured areas?
