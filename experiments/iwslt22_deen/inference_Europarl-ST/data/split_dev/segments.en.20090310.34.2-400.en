Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, no serious scientist doubts that there must be a drastic application of the brakes to the consumption of fossil fuels, as the raw materials are limited and as the combustion of fossil fuels is the main cause of the climate chaos.
We all know that around a third of fossil fuels are squandered on travel and transport and that goods vehicles, in particular, cause enormous damage to people and the environment that the taxpayer then has to pay for.
Everyone essentially agrees to the principle of paying the true costs.
Yet, when it comes to the specific measures to implement true costs, we hear a thousand excuses.
It is thoroughly incomprehensible why the actions being taken in response to the crises are not much more consistent.
It is wrong to continue to promote the unhealthy and bloated transport economy.
The 20-20-20 target will otherwise grow ever more distant.
We must be clear that this dishonesty jeopardises the future of our grandchildren.
