Mr President, European rail transport remains dominated by the monopolies, and different types of current, different track gauges and even different safety requirements are preventing the expansion of cross-border rail transport.
The European Parliament has therefore decided to recast what is known as the railway package.
In future, strong authorities – known as regulators – in all the Member States will ensure that these barriers are removed, that we bring about a
customer-friendly liberalisation of the market and that those who continue to block service-oriented competition will be rapped across the knuckles.
I have therefore been vehement in my support of this directive.
At the same time, this decision is the first step towards a European, uniform and thus competitive rail market.
Only once the barriers that exist in rail transport have been removed completely will Europe benefit from the new rail transport corridors, and only then will the businesses along these corridors be able to develop too.
What I would like is for us to be able to travel all the way across Europe in the near future using just one engine, one set of carriages and one ticket.
