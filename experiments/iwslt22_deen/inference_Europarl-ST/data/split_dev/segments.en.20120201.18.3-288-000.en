. Mr President, firstly I would like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent report.
The most important thing for me in presenting the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs was to emphasise that sport makes an important contribution to the economy, alongside its well-known health and social benefits.
I am sure that we can generate added value in this area at a European level.
However, I believe that the subsidiarity principle should continue to play a central role in sport.
Sport must remain close to the people.
This works most effectively when it is organised on a national, regional and local level.
Over and above the points mentioned, the European Union should restrict itself to establishing a suitable legal framework.
This applies, for example, to the public funding of sport, competition rules and also competitions and usage rights.
Therefore, I welcome the fact that these considerations have been included in the report and I can give the text my full support.
