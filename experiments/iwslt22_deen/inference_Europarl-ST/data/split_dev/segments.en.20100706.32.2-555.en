Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I too would like to express my thanks to Mrs Liotard.
The Group of the European People â€™ s Party (Christian Democrats) cannot support her on every point.
We take a different view regarding additives and animals fed with feed derived from GMO plants. However, she has done an excellent job.
I also want to thank our shadow rapporteur, Mrs Ayuso, for the excellent work she has done.
However, as she has already mentioned, there was a controversial debate within our group on the topic of animal cloning.
I am pleased to say as coordinator that the majority of the PPE Group are in favour of the ban on cloning and that we will also vote in favour tomorrow as a group, regardless of individual opinions which take a different view on this.
The following important reasons were put forward during the discussion in the group. Firstly, even our agricultural experts do not feel it is necessary for us to have meat from cloned animals to guarantee our food supply.
We do not need it.
Unfortunately, we must say on ethical grounds that, if the cloning of animals is used on a large scale, it will also become easier to clone people, which is quite clearly unethical.
The population is very evidently against it, as stated by all the surveys. I am sure that we are not just talking here about a vague gut feeling. Anyone who has taken a really close look
has taken a really close look at the statement from the EFSA cannot endorse it in good conscience. It contains so many unanswered questions, justifying this sense of unease.
However, the crucial reason is animal protection.
This is mentioned by the EFSA, EGE and many other agencies.
Cloned animals suffer.
Only around 10% of implanted embryos ever reach birth, and then a third of them die by the third month.
They suffer an agonising death.
They often need to be put to sleep because they have terrible diseases.
Animal protection is not just a principle which we can apply willy-nilly.
The authors of the treaties have imposed this on us.
We must absolutely avoid creating laws which fail to take animal protection into consideration.
It is for these reasons that we will be supporting it tomorrow too, with a large majority.
