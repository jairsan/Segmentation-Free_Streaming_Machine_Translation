Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the free movement of workers, the freedom of establishment and the freedom to provide services are vital pillars of our internal market.
Of course, these must not act as a gateway for social dumping.
Service providers must respect the law of the State in which they operate.
The country of destination principle must thus also be enforced consistently.
For that to happen, all the Member States must also do their homework.
My home country of Germany has not done its homework in this regard, as there is quite clearly a lack of framework conditions for fair mobility and social security.
There are no binding wage floors in many areas, the monitoring of undeclared work is inadequate and we have fictive self-employment as a common way of circumventing labour law.
As Mr Geier already said, we also need advice centres in different languages for posted workers, not just for companies.
If the freedom to provide services is also to benefit workers, there is still some homework to be done.
