. Madam President, I welcome the fact that the Council has adopted Parliament ’ s proposals and that it wants to take action to tackle youth unemployment.
The Youth Guarantee scheme proposed, or rather cited, by Mr Barroso was a proposal by the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance, from the own-initiative report which they earlier submitted to this House.
However, unlike him, I believe that the focus should be on disadvantaged young people, in particular.
This requires decentralised action.
That would be much more appropriate here.
The European Social Fund (ESF) money should remain in place and be allocated anew when the relevant location deems it appropriate.
I address this to Mr Barroso.
Similarly, our group supports the Council ’ s decision on a green economy.
That, too, originated in a Verts / ALE own-initiative report, which was adopted here in the plenary by a large majority two years ago.
Hence, our demand, as part of the reprogramming of Structural Funds, that we focus on the green economy in areas where initiatives are needed.
SMEs are exactly the kind of enterprises for which such a line is essential, because it would make them competitive.
We must not allow money to be thrown out the window just like that. We need sustainable projects, those from which the next generations will be able to profit.
