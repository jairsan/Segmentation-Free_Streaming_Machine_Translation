Madam President, the European Union already has around 40 EU agencies.
Every year, these organisations gobble up EUR 1.5 billion.
The Council and Member States have never had any problem making quick-fire decisions to establish such agencies.
The Council and Member States have also never had any problem with the fact that the agencies very often breach the principle of subsidiarity with their activities. Most of all, there is frequently no rationale given for these agencies.
We now have three new agencies which are going to be set up, three sensible agencies which have powers that are to be exercised in an area where the European Union can finally prove how much we need them.
However, Member States are now putting up resistance in a situation where the policy has been lagging behind the global impact of the financial markets for years, if not decades.
If, on the one hand, the European Union operates where it is not needed and, on the other, fails to do so where we urgently need it, the annoyance which this causes its citizens is quite understandable.
All that remains for me to do is to ask the Council finally to act sensibly and drop its obstructive attitude.
