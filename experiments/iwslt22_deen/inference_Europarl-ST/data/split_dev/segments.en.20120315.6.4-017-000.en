. Mr President, Commissioner, climate protection requires immediate measures, as well as a long-term strategy if we are to achieve the objective of stabilising the Earth ’ s atmosphere at 2 ° C.
The Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament supports your Roadmap for 2050.
It is an extremely important element in guaranteeing planning certainty and clarity in relation to where the path is to take us.
All those involved, particularly the economic sector, eagerly await this planning certainty and clarity.
This makes it all the more regrettable that Friday ’ s Environment Council meeting was blocked by one country, showing itself to be incapable of making political decisions.
I would like to ask the Commission: what is your strategy for rescuing Poland from this psychological and political isolation?
We need Poland. Poland is an important country.
We need to make it clear that Poland also has enormous opportunities to modernise its economy and deploy new technology in pursuing its climate strategy.
Perhaps it is necessary to clarify the assistance the EU can offer and the way in which the effort is distributed among all 27 countries, all of which share a common goal, but which may have different ways of reaching that goal.
Commissioner, you must be able to provide an answer here.
If we want to reduce CO emissions by 80 to 95%, we need to embrace all sectors, not just industry, but also transport and agriculture.
I hope that the amendments tabled here will not dilute our report.
We need to speak out clearly in relation to climate neutrality in the transport sector and in favour of major efforts in the agricultural sector.
We would encourage you to include not just aviation, but also marine transport in the emissions trading system.
You need to show leadership here, and you should not give in.
The Emissions Trading System is not working.
You need to take corrective action.
This report indicates how this can work.
I believe, in the final analysis, that we are witnessing a new industrial revolution.
The issue at stake is a competitive European economy and climate protection is a key element in the competitiveness of Europe in the 21st century.
