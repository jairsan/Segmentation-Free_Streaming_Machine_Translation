Mr President, Commissioner Potočnik has thanked this Parliament emphatically for the fact that we have stayed so hard-headed with this legislative package, and that we have contributed to the big push forward that will now take place on the prevention of air pollution.
The thanks for this must, of course, go to our rapporteur, Mr Krahmer, for his excellent work, but also to all the shadow rapporteurs and the others who stayed with us on this objective to make Europe ’ s air cleaner.
The European Environment Agency has given us a report which shows that in some areas, we still have a bad situation as regards air pollution, nitrogen oxides and dust.
Commissioner, you said it yourself.
Now we hope that, with this new amendment, you will also have a tool for carrying out controls.
We hope that you will also really implement this in a hard-headed manner and not accept any major exemptions or time wasting.
After all, the previous directive dates from 1996 – that is, 14 years ago! I can understand the new Member States such as Poland and others, but I cannot understand the old Member States at all – the
– the fact that in all these years, so little has been done, and the arguments that we hear again in this instance too, with regard to jobs and costs. Well, of course, these things always turn out badly; if we wait too long, then everything comes at once.
If we do our work on time, then we can also carry out innovations and still protect jobs.
Thus we have a great success, though it is spoiled somewhat by the large combustion plants.
The small fry are arrested, while the big fish are allowed to go free.
What happens so often in life is also unfortunately happening here with industrial plants.
