Madam President, High Representative, I would like to stress one more time very clearly that, as well as the self-evidently important areas such as environmental and energy issues, the question of shipping routes has a very special role to play.
Given that ships sailing traditional shipping routes are being seized, since the lives of captains and crews are being jeopardised by this, as these routes are really unsafe, shipowners are looking for new routes.
In my home town of Hamburg, this discussion is of very major importance.
I would very much like to encourage you to continue on this route in this EU Arctic debate.
