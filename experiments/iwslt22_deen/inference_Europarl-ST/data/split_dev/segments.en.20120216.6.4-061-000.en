Mr President, I welcome the fact that trading relations are to be established with a view to creating a Euro-Mediterranean free trade area in response to the Arab Spring, and that the over 100 bilateral protocols are to be brought together in a single regional agreement.
I would, however, like to draw attention to one critical point, namely, products that purportedly originate from Israel.
There have been some serious flaws in the implementation of the association agreement between the EU and Israel concluded in 1995.
We in this House are all aware of this.
I recently drew attention to precisely this flaw in a written question to the Commission.
We know from several sources, including our customs authorities, that Israeli settlers have intentionally falsely labelled goods produced in the occupied Palestinian territories, including fruit and vegetables, also issuing these goods with falsified certificates, declaring the country of origin of these products to be Israel.
This was in order for this produce to gain access to the EU â€™ s single market at preferential conditions, including lower tax rates.
We cannot have a situation whereby this new agreement will also be misused in further extending this illegal practice.
Mr Barnier, I believe it is extremely important that the aforementioned list of the designations of origin of the various Palestinian villages and towns should be published.
Our delegation has long been of the view that this list should not be kept secret, but should be published in the interests of greater transparency and clarity and to help restrict abuses.
