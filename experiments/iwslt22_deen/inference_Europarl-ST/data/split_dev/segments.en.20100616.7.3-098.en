Madam President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, the EU-Russia Summit has produced reasonable results, in particular, as far as specifying the details of the Partnership for Modernisation is concerned.
I very much welcome the fact that dialogue between the civil societies has been seen as a priority in this partnership.
As the chair of the European Parliament delegation for relations with Russia, I led a working group meeting in Perm a few days ago specifically on the subject of developing the civil society.
We have once again seen how much progress has been made in Russia in recent years, but also how much still remains to be done and how much we can contribute to the discussions on the basis of our experiences, both good and otherwise.
Exchange and movement are key concepts for me.
There can be no Partnership for Modernisation without the movement of people.
For this reason, I am rather disappointed that the EU has not really made much progress in the area of travel without visas.
We must now set specific objectives which the EU and Russia can work together to achieve.
This is not about meeting schedules and certainly not about following certain sequences of events. It is all about ensuring that we take a predictable approach to these issues, that the
criteria are clearly defined and that everyone, including Russia, can be sure that when these conditions are fulfilled and when the specific problems are solved, visa liberalisation will be possible.
