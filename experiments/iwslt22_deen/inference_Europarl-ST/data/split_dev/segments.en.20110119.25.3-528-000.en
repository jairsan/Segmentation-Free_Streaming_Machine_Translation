Mr President, Baroness Ashton, I would like to thank you for your rapid response to the events in Minsk.
I also admire the concept that you have produced.
It represents a good balance between sanctions against those who are responsible for the serious violations of human rights and measures to support the population of Belarus.
I would also like to thank the Munich security conference, which cancelled Mr Lukashenko â€™ s invitation.
This sent out a clear signal that dictators have no place on international committees and should not be acknowledged by being invited to attend their meetings.
International recognition of a self-declared president weakens the opposition in his country and could also be regarded as international recognition of the non-democratic elections.
This is why the response of the conference was exactly the right one.
We know that we will have a long wait before we see any political changes in this country.
We are also aware that Mr Lukashenko has been in power for a long time and that his reaction is typical.
However, we cannot wait when it comes to the humanitarian situation in Belarus, Baroness Ashton.
We must react very quickly and ensure that the political prisoners are released, that parents are returned to their children and children to their parents.
They have done nothing more than demonstrating in support of their democratic rights and making their feelings clear on the streets.
The response to their actions was unjustified.
Baroness Ashton, I call on you to act quickly and to make it clear in every statement that these are political prisoners and not criminals.
I would like to send greetings to Andrei Sannikov and the others who are in prison.
They should be aware that they have our solidarity.
