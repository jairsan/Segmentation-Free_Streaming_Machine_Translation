Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the signs look very promising for the EU-Africa summit.
The summit will revolve entirely around an equal partnership for a better common future.
Two months after the Millennium Development Goals summit in New York, we have the unique opportunity to take further specific, binding steps in the fight against poverty in Africa.
We are, of course, following all of China ’ s extensive activities on the African continent to safeguard its own supply of raw materials with great concern.
It is very much reminiscent of the behaviour of colonial states.
The European Union must, therefore, press for a regulation that promotes the common good of, and social progress in, the African countries.
That will create work that is sustainable.
I therefore expressly welcome the Commission ’ s proposal to employ effective controls in the context of raw materials management.
Together with the African partners, we need to support a structural policy that promotes growth and climate protection in order for the African people to escape from the poverty trap.
We support the Commission ’ s proposals for social cohesion, because they will help to create jobs.
We must put the people of Africa in a position where they can achieve the goal of earning a living wage through their own work.
Finally, I would like to provide a summary of the following priorities. Firstly, we need to strengthen the African Union and its representations in all international bodies – the Security Council, G20 and the Pan-African Parliament.
The Millennium Goals must be achieved in Africa by 2015 by means of further initiatives.
We must ensure that the social standards stipulated by the International Labour Organisation (ILO) are laid down and made binding in any economic and trade agreements between the EU and Africa.
