Mr President, Commissioner, the idea of a one-stop shop is to be welcomed, but it is a paradigm shift for some European countries – including my own, Austria, where residence permits are issued by the authorities dealing with
permits are issued by the authorities dealing with third-party rights and work permits by the authorities responsible for the labour market, the Austrian Employment Service, with the involvement of the social partners.
Regulation of access to the labour market directly affects the social partners and they should therefore be involved in its substance.
The discussion that has taken place to date has involved the trade unions far too little, and NGOs and churches have been similarly excluded.
Many of the previous speakers have said that migration policy must be viewed as a whole.
I am therefore against the Commission ’ s piecemeal approach that splits up the package and thereby introduces through the back door the country of origin principle, and possibly even social dumping, as has also been mentioned already.
Allow me to make a comment on the legal nature of the supplementary document.
A credit card format will not be able to accommodate all the official orders and data, so the supplementary document also needs to be normative in nature.
Only then will efficient controls be possible.
This serves to protect workers and prevents competition being distorted in a way which benefits those enterprises that wish to grow rich on the backs of illegal workers.
