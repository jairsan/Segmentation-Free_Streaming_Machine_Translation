Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, since our coordinator, Jean-Paul Gauzès, finds himself unable to use his speaking time at short notice, he has asked me to speak on his behalf.
In other words, you have a different representative addressing you now.
The report concerns increasing the capital stock of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) from EUR 20 billion to EUR 30 billion, in order to safeguard the EBRD ’ s AAA rating and maintain current voting rights within the EBRD.
The Group of the European People ’ s Party (Christian Democrats) supports the call for the Commission and the Member States to submit an assessment of the European public investment banking system to the European Parliament.
Equally important to us is the demand that the Governor of the EBRD report annually to the competent committee of the European Parliament
on the promotion of the Union ’ s objectives, with particular regard to the EU ’ s Millennium Development Goals and the Europe 2020 strategy – as Mr Schmidt has already mentioned.
Moreover, it is to be welcomed that, following the committee ’ s report, there must always be public disclosure of evaluations of projects and beneficiaries of the EBRD and that there will be tighter controls in future.
This will prevent secrecy by beneficiaries or the use of tax havens by projects in which the bank is involved.
That is very much to be welcomed.
Our coordinator told me that two trialogues took place this summer.
The results have the full support of our group.
The PPE Group will therefore also vote in favour in this instance.
