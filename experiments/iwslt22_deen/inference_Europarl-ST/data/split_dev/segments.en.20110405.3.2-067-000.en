Madam President, Mr Barroso, Mr Van Rompuy, I would like to ask you a few questions.
It is good that an agreement has been reached.
It is good that the European economy and European currency will now be better protected.
But is protection enough on its own?
Is it not necessary to go further?
Is it not necessary to stimulate an upturn, so that we can preserve what we are protecting?
I believe that too little is being done and that the wrong strategy is being followed.
Why is the European Union investing in the export of cucumbers, bananas and live cattle rather than in universities, places of learning and schools?
This is something which we need to consider.
When you say that we have no money for this, then perhaps what is needed is some reorganisation.
We should consider whether we need new sources of income, in which case we need look no further than those who have always profited from this unspeakable situation.
Mr Barroso, what is the real reason for your Commission â€™ s opposition to a financial transaction tax?
Please answer this question for me.
You need to decide once and for all whether you are on the side of the financial industry or of our citizens.
