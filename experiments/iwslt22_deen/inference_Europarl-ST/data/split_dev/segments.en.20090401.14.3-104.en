Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this directive finally closes the gaps in anti-discrimination law, and allows the European Union to
meet its international obligations to protect human rights, as well as its obligations under the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.
Ladies and gentlemen of the Group of the European People â€™ s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, your arguments against the directive are populist and misleading. What right do you have to deny people with
to deny people with disabilities unrestricted access to education, or older people equal treatment regarding insurance and financial services?
What concept do you have of humanity?
Unrestricted participation in society is a human right, and for that reason we will fight for this directive and for equal opportunities for all.
In my view, it is totally inhumane to require victims of discrimination to provide proof of the discrimination.
If you, ladies and gentlemen of the PPE-DE Group, delete the shift in the burden of proof, you will be putting at risk the basic right of some groups to protection of their human dignity, and we find that unacceptable.
We want equality for all in protection against discrimination, and we Greens will fight for that.
We will not allow human rights to become a plaything for populist scaremongering.
I can predict right now that you will lose tomorrow; the majority of this House will vote in favour of the human right of protection from discrimination.
Of that I am certain.
