Mr President, the drastic economic situation naturally also calls for radical savings to be made in the EU budget, but I can find no sign of these priorities and, in particular, the courage needed to do that in this report.
Quite the opposite, in fact. Complaints are still being made that the increase in the budget is too small.
The report thus seeks to preserve the status quo and does not make real progress in any particular direction.
It would be very easy – particularly in the area of administration – to make large savings on supposedly trivial things.
I am thinking, for example, of the area of EU agencies.
By closing down or merging EU agencies, we could save half a billion euro in a year without actually reducing the quality of the administration, or perhaps we could also wind up the Committee of the Regions or the European Economic and Social Committee.
We could surely easily save EUR 200 million in a year by doing that, and if we sell the buildings we can save as much again.
Perhaps we should look at ourselves. We could also start to make savings in the European Parliament.
For example, we could all stop travelling business class within Europe.
That could also enable us to make a very reasonable contribution.
What I like about this report – and I wanted to mention this – is the priority given to lifelong learning.
In this regard, we should, in particular, be setting the priorities for the Leonardo da Vinci programme.
Trainee exchange is very important.
Perhaps we should also create a financial instrument that would enable at least part of the costs to be paid for all of those citizens who want to make use of this citizens ’ initiative.
