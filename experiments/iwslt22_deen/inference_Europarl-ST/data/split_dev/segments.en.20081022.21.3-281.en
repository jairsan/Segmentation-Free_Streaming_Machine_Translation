Madam President, I would like to start by thanking the members of the Committee on Budgets for the fact that they broadly share the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs ’ approach to the budget.
Nevertheless, I would like, once again, to make the case for increasing funding for social dialogue appropriately, as we proposed.
We cannot keep talking about how social dialogue is a pillar of our European social model, and then on the other hand reduce funding in exactly this area.
At this point, I would also call on the Council to work with us to find a solution for the problem of the degressivity clause.
It has a particularly dramatic effect on the work of the trade union institutes, and, over the long term, continual funding cuts are simply no longer sustainable.
With regard the Committee ’ s two pilot projects, allow me to say one thing: there was a broad consensus in favour of a pilot project relating to posted workers, and I am sure that the results of this project will bring us important insights for our future political decisions on the Posting of Workers Directive.
We will therefore certainly pay close attention to ensure that the Commission, in turn, turns its attention to those aspects that are important to us in this project, to prevent wage dumping and social dumping.
The second project relates to violence against the elderly. This project confronts a taboo subject, and this is particularly important.
