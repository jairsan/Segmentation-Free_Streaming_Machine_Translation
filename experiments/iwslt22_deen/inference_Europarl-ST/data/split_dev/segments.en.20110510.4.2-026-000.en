. Madam President, I would like to use a minute now as rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Regional Development and then speak for two minutes later in the debate on behalf of my group.
Madam President, Mr Becsey, Commissioner Šemeta, President Caldeira, ladies and gentlemen, the regional policy budget remains the Achilles heel of the European Union general budget.
Five percent of payments from the European Regional Fund still have errors and must therefore be described as irregular payments.
Even some of the payments that appear to be correct are actually supporting grotesque projects.
May I remind you that an Elton John concert in Naples was subsidised by the European Regional Fund.
It was said to be a measure to promote tourism.
That might be the case, but in my opinion real regional aid for Naples should take a different form.
The reason for this is that all too often the Member States still consider funding from the European Regional Fund to be soft money.
This is obvious from the fact that there is a backlog of repayments due from irregular payments, from the fact that very often the Commission has to use the instrument of suspending payments – something that, as budget controllers, we expressly welcome – and from the fact that the punctuality of reporting suffers.
The Director General for Regional Policy cannot provide us with any assurance as to the legality and reliability of over half the operational programmes because the reporting by the Member States is inadequate.
Ladies and gentlemen, we still have a lot to do here.
