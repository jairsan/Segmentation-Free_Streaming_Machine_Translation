Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I would like to express my sincere thanks to Mrs Sommer for her tough, committed work.
She has been subjected to some baseless criticism that she does not deserve.
That also obscures the fact that there are many matters on which we agree.
We all want better labelling of imitation foods.
Cheese is made of milk, and if it contains other things, then it must be labelled as an imitation on the front of the packaging.
We also all want binding nutritional labelling.
We do not yet have this.
It is something that we all want.
We also all want it to be in a unit that consumers understand.
On this matter, allow me to tell you a joke that is doing the rounds here in Germany – and perhaps in some other countries too: ‘ What do you call the little animals that sew your clothes tighter while they are in the wardrobe?
Calories.
’ Nobody anywhere in Europe would tell this joke using kilojoules.
The kilojoule has not taken off as a unit. It confuses people and therefore, we do not need to specify it as mandatory information.
The calorie is the unit that informed consumers use in their calculations.
There is thus a great deal of agreement.
There are also differences, for example, on the matter of nutritional profiles.
Our group wishes these to be removed, or at least clarification that basic foods will be exempt.
There has been heated discussion over salt in bread, French cheese and similar things.
I would like to thank Commissioner Dalli and President Barroso for having attempted to provide clarification on these matters.
There is no College decision, however, and consequently, we need this to be clarified once and for all.
I would ask you to support the amendments put forward by the Group of the European People ’ s Party (Christian Democrats) in this area.
