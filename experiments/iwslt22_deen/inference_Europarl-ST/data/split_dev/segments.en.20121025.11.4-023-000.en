. Mr President, it is very hard for me to tell you what trade unions can do as far as creating jobs is concerned.
Two things they certainly can do, however, are to cooperate actively in developing models – such as the dual system in Austria of employment allied to vocational training – and to contribute constructive ideas on how training should be developed.
They are, in fact, doing this.
Of course, they should also be doing this in Spain.
