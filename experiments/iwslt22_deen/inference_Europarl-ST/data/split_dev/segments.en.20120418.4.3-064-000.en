Commissioner, I am afraid that I find your answer inadequate.
In Article 9 of your proposal, you listed what measures Member States may take.
In other words, you are going further than the original regulation.
The original regulation allows Member States the freedom to implement the controls in the best and most efficient possible way.
As soon as you list the measures permissible, you are limiting the controls.
When that happens, the result is exactly the kind of scenario that I related in connection with Berlin.
This means that many workers in Europe are cheated of their pay.
Surely you cannot allow yourself to be responsible for that? As far as I am concerned, the question is this: why are you interfering, via your Article 9, in the competence of the Member States to implement controls?
