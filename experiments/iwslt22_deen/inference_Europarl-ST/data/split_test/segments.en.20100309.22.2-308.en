I wish you a very warm welcome to this House.
The loss of confidence in Copenhagen was, in my opinion, one of the major problems.
This could theoretically continue worldwide, but also within the European Union.
My question to you is as follows. What is happening with the instruments that we adopted last year?
The Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) is of concern to me, because I am not entirely sure what the Commission is currently doing in light of the decision in Copenhagen, for example, with regard to benchmarks, but also to carbon leakage.
My second question is as follows. The French Government has put forward a proposal to incorporate importers from developing countries into the
developing countries into the ETS system in order to make the market bigger and to allow these countries to participate in this system.
Do you have an opinion on this?
