Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it was exactly 20 years ago that the Central Asian states received their national independence as a result of the collapse of the Soviet Union.
Emerging from a dictatorship, the development of democratic structures and the rule of law in these states remains a constant challenge.
Nevertheless, on account of their rich deposits of mineral resources and raw materials, these states are important trading partners for the EU and its Member States.
It is therefore only logical to regulate the EU â€™ s relations with these states within the framework of partnership and cooperation agreements.
Partnership and cooperation agreements should facilitate cooperation and lead to the two parties trading as partners, but not to unilateral stigmatisation.
Child labour, and particularly forced child labour, is an evil that, unfortunately, is prevalent in many countries of this world and must be combated.
However, I would ask you to consider the fact that in many European regions dominated by agriculture, it was common for the school holidays to be extended for the children during harvest time in order to allow children from farming families to help out with the harvest, which is something that no one would describe as forced labour today.
However, should there be indications that forced child labour is being used in the cotton harvest in Uzbekistan, then the appropriate action must be taken.
The same action must then be taken for all other states in which there is still child labour, even for those states where we are pursuing economic interests on a completely different scale, like India or China.
We must not apply double standards here.
