Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, according to this report, the Commission is following a successful policy on competition.
However, we should not forget that unregulated competition can also lead to an increase in unemployment, so that the gap between the rich and poor grows ever wider.
In the European Union, free competition continues to take precedence over the social needs of our citizens.
A fervent belief in free markets cannot mask the fact that these markets not only fail time and time again, but are also incapable of bringing about lasting social justice.
A couple of procedures aimed at combating distortion of competition and price fixing will not be enough to resolve this problem.
A fair and social internal market will only work with strong and just regulation.
More work is urgently needed on this.
For example, it is not acceptable for more and more institutions providing services of general public interest to find themselves exposed to private competition.
The report sets down pointers for the Commission â€™ s future policy on competition.
There is an urgent need for much stronger consumer protection and for services of general public interest to be shielded from the rules of competition and removed from the control of cartels.
It is also necessary to introduce a contractual clause that favours secure social progress and that is regarded with the same importance as the rules on competition in Europe.
