Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that Schengen is one of the greatest achievements in the European Union, however I am also aware that our Member States are sensitive of their borders and are likely to remain so.
I am aware that the problems that exist between the Member States in relation to Schengen cannot simply be ignored.
These problems are many and varied.
Ignoring these problems does not make them any better or easier to resolve.
I live near the border with the Czech Republic and no one on our side would ever dream of simply closing the border again when problems are encountered.
I would also call on the Commission to offer support in this area, rather than restrictions and rebukes.
Dragnet controls were incorporated because we wish to ensure security while still allowing freedom to travel.
If we are to be successful in implementing dragnet controls at locations that are frequent crossing points for drug dealers, such as the Czech border in particular,
then I believe it is best for the German and Czech interior ministers to sit down together to find a joint solution to the problems that exist at the border.
The Commission should not adopt a regulatory role here, but rather a positive supporting role.
We wish to rein in the populists, but also to resolve the real problems in a concerted approach. That is why I am also calling on the Council to seek a solution together with Parliament, so that we can successfully conclude the Schengen dossier, upholding freedom to travel while also ensuring the security of our citizens.
