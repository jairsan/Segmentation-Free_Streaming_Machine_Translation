. − Mr President, Commissioner, I was not entirely satisfied by your answer.
I consider it a very long period of time if it is possible for a year to pass between notification that a complaint has been received and the issuing of a response.
In my view a complainant who makes this effort – and in most cases he will already have been through the entire legal process in his own Member State – deserves more.
We are reliant on citizens who are committed to the European Union.
If they demonstrate their commitment in this form, we should treat them accordingly.
I believe it is necessary and absolutely essential in the long term that we have a procedure here that is clearly formalised and clearly regulates rights, by which I mean an explanation of how the Commission intends to handle this.
With regard to another point: I have nothing against it, should this prove helpful, if an attempt is made together with the Member State to bring about a kind of mutual resolution.
That will not always be sufficient, however.
We can see that things move relatively quickly in economic matters, for example, when a company institutes proceedings against another due to an infringement of EU law.
If, however, the matter relates, for example, to environmental or similar concerns, an area in which a large number of citizens are calling for action by the European Union, or social rights, the proceedings are somewhat slower.
I believe that these facts must also be given careful consideration.
For my next report I would like us to have clearly formalised the rights of the complainant in relation to the Commission, for these to be really clear and also to be really well communicated.
If we really want European law to be applied, after we have decided on it together, following a whole host of procedures in the European Parliament and Council
have decided on it together, following a whole host of procedures in the European Parliament and Council, we must provide information as efficiently and precisely as possible to people who care about such things, who really get involved in European issues.
This is a matter of great concern to me.
Next time I will look carefully once again to see what developments have been made in this area.
