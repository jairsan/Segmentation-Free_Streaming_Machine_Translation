Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, on the subject of the intermediate category, I would definitely also have been able to imagine other solutions in the beginning, Mr Pieper, for example a transitional regulation for the regions which have received the highest levels of subsidies until now and which will no longer do so after 2013.
However, it emerged from the discussion that we need to take into consideration other regions, in particular those hit by the crisis.
We are currently talking about 51 regions.
When confronted with so many regions that have been affected, it would be negligent not to establish an intermediate category.
This is the only way in which we can create a reliable framework for providing responsible subsidies to these regions which have to compensate for their slow progress in development themselves.
In other respects, Mr Pieper â€™ s report contains a great deal of light and shade.
Among other things, we are critical of the fact that there is no clear commitment to a much more decisive approach to combating poverty. We believe that the wording of the report which makes cohesion policy subject to conditions that force the Member States to implement reforms is unclear and liable to misinterpretation.
It goes without saying that cohesion policy must remain an instrument for social balance and solidarity throughout all the regions.
