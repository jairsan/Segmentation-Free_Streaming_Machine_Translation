Ms Swinburne, you just said that everything that is argued in favour of the financial transaction tax is speculation, but you followed this with some very speculative examples of your own.
light of what you said, I should like to know what you think of these investigations that have been carried out by the Commission and the study carried out by the Commission, which establish very, very clearly that, by oversight, there has been too little consideration of the real economy ’ s dependence on the financial markets, that 95% of companies are not dependent on it in
has been too little consideration of the real economy ’ s dependence on the financial markets, that 95% of companies are not dependent on it in any way for raising funds, and that it is highly likely that any negative effect on growth that has been mentioned in the past could be turned into a positive by making appropriate public investments to promote growth.
Do you see that as mere speculation, too, or would you say that such a well-based, broad study by the Commission is also well reasoned and forms a strong argument?
