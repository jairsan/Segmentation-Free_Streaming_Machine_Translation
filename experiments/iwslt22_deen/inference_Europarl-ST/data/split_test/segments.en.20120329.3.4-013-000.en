Mr President, Mr Rehn, ladies and gentlemen, if I have understood you correctly, Mr Rehn, what you have said today is that the Commission is fighting to ensure the continuation of the food programme for the most deprived people in the European Union.
It will do everything in its power to put concrete proposals on the table in the near future concerning where exactly the programme will be based and how it will be financed.
I believe that this is urgently needed and I think that we have a joint responsibility to ensure that the food programme becomes reality.
not because I see it as a last resort, but because from my perspective, it sends out a signal that we still have a fundamental sense of solidarity with the day-to-day lives of those people in the
lives of those people in the European Union who, unfortunately, are not able to take part in any of the developments going on around them and who have become the first and most serious victims of the methods used by the European Union to combat the crisis.
I am thinking about Greece, Spain and other countries where the measures that the European Union is taking are having the greatest impact on the poorest of the poor.
We are sending out a signal but, unfortunately, it is no more than that.
Therefore, I think we urgently need to put combating poverty at the top of our main agenda, and not just for the sake of the 18 million people in the European Union who are currently dependent on food
put combating poverty at the top of our main agenda, and not just for the sake of the 18 million people in the European Union who are currently dependent on food aid.
Until now, we have not sent out a clear enough signal.
However, in my view, this is the decisive point if we want to continue to make progress and if we want the citizens of the European Union to have confidence in us to create a social Union with a strong sense of solidarity.
In this respect, you have our support.
However, ladies and gentlemen, we are also called upon to ensure that the governments which are currently blocking this programme adopt a different attitude.
This is a personal commitment that we must make.
