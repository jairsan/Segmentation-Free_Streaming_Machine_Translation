Mr President, Commissioner, I very much like your proposal regarding the productivity-aligned wage policy.
When it comes to the minimum wage, however, you have given in to Chancellor Merkel, and I do not believe you when it comes to increasing employment in health care.
How are new jobs supposed to emerge there when the Commission has already forced southern and eastern Member States to reduce their hospital capacities by a half?
How are jobs supposed to arise in health care when the Commission requires some Member States to reduce their expenditure on health care further in the new country-specific recommendations for the European Semester?
I fear that this point in this plan is pure gesture politics, not a real initiative for new jobs.
On the contrary, there is already a shortage of drugs and medicines as a result of the austerity measures, and not just in Greece.
I feel that if we are constantly designing new rescue packages for the banks, then we must now work for a rescue package for people and, in particular, to secure medical supplies in the crisis countries.
