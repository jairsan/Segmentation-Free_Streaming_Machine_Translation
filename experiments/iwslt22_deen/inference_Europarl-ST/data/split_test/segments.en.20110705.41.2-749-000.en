Mr President, Mr Kallas, Mr Grabarczyk, I would like to join with previous speakers in thanking the rapporteur, Mrs Ayala Sender.

During the trialogues we agreed that the joint statement on this subject would help us to find an overall compromise.
I would very briefly like to remind everyone that tomorrow the European Association …
