Mr FÃ¤rm, you are from a country that declined to join the euro, mainly because it wished to retain the flexibility of devaluation, precisely in order to use it as a social policy instrument.
In the light of current experience in Sweden, would you recommend to the Greeks that they also leave the euro area, so that they, too, can actively use devaluation as a social policy instrument?
