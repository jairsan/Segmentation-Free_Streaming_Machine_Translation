Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the massacre on 23 November of last year in the Province of Maguindanao in the Philippines was a black day for human rights and a barbaric act of terrorism.
Fifty seven people were killed, women were raped, people were injured – they convey a bloody message.
As a journalist, it struck me, in particular, that there were 30 journalists among those killed.
According to the renowned International Crisis Group, in no other case on record have more journalists ever been murdered at one time.
For this reason, it is appropriate for the European Parliament to make a clear statement, as we are doing today in this draft resolution.
However, as the Group of the European People ’ s Party (Christian Democrats), we request that the present text be toned down in three places through a split vote, because we ought to support the Philippine Government in its fight against terrorism and violence and therefore dispense with overly accusatory remarks directed at the government.
Therefore, on behalf of the PPE Group, I request a separate vote on recital F. This accuses the Philippines of showing all the signs of a non-functional legal system.
In paragraph 2, we would like to delete the insinuation about what are referred to as initial delays in the investigation.
Finally, in paragraph 6, it is claimed that some missing persons are locked away in Philippine prisons.
This, too, is currently an unproven insinuation and should, in our opinion, be deleted.
