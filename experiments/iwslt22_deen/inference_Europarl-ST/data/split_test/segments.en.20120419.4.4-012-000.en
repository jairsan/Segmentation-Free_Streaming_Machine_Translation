. Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her dedicated and exemplary work.
I agree with many of the criticisms expressed by Ms in 't Veld and have supported them in the past, in part at least.
We always reach a point, however, where people need to take responsibility.
On behalf of the Group of the European People â€™ s Party (Christian Democrats) and on my own behalf I would state that we now need to deal with the realities of the situation, rather than taking recourse to ideological or theoretical positions.
The fact is that the US has been gathering this PNR data for 10 years without a single complaint.
It is also the case that none of us wants to put a stop to data traffic, even if we are not in favour of the agreement.
You have just said so yourself.
Nor do we want to bring air travel between Europe and the US to a standstill.
The fact is also that the US has a right to know who enters its territory.
In my opinion, it is also a fact that the legal services have all made oral indications that this agreement is better than the alternatives.
This is the reason why we need people to take responsibility here.
After all, that is what we have been elected to do.
We need to take responsibility for our citizens, as otherwise they would be abandoned with little protection and few rights.
We need to take responsibility for the airlines, as otherwise, as the Commissioner also pointed out, they would be left with absolutely no legal certainty.
We also need to take responsibility for the EU as a contracting partner in questions of data protection and security, as well as responsibility for a good balance between security and data protection.
Hence we are generally in favour of this agreement, even though it is by no means perfect.
If we want to protect our citizens and offer them better data protection, then we also need to take responsibility here and vote in favour of this agreement.
