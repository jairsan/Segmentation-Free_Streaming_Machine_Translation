Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is no coincidence that we are not finding it easy to agree on this matter here because we are combining two incompatible issues.
If we had concentrated on trademark protection, we would probably have been able to reach a good agreement.
However, mixing this with the subject of the Internet is also substantially incorrect, because different and newer strategies are required here compared with those required in substantive law.
It is not easy to transfer these strategies from the one to the other.
We also need to be clear in our own minds that we will pay for every prosecution on the Internet with infringements of civil rights, because we cannot see or find these things out automatically.
Thirdly, it is abundantly clear to me that if I place cultural enjoyment on the Internet under the threat of punishment, so that I virtually risk being sent to prison every time
prison every time I view the Internet, I will not be able to make use of the opportunities that the Internet also provides for art, culture and creativity.
I would therefore urge us to discuss this matter further.
That would be a more intelligent approach.
