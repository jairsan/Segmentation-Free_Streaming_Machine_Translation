Madam President, Mrs Kroes, the spectrum is a valuable and limited resource that must be managed with care and foresight, taking into account society as a whole.
The radio spectrum policy programme is therefore of particular importance.
The spectrum must be utilised efficiently, taking into account economic, social and cultural aspects.
To this end, we must fully utilise the technical means available to us in all bands to achieve the greatest possible efficiency.
The telecoms package adopted last year must form the basis of our radio spectrum policy because it also stipulates that the spectrum management of the EU and its Member States must take equal account of cultural, social and economic interests.
This must be taken into consideration, in particular, in connection with the harmonisation of spectrum use in the EU.
In this regard, I would like to point out that implementation of the first digital dividend in the Member States has so far been progressing at very different rates.
Further opening of the UHF band, particularly below 800 MHz, should therefore only be considered after taking into account our experience with white spaces in this band.
There are many technical and financial questions that are yet to be definitively resolved.
In particular, the problem of interference and the question of cost offsetting for cultural facilities and local authorities in connection with technical retrofitting, with regard to radio microphones for example, have not yet been satisfactorily resolved.
When allocating frequency bands, the various different interests must be weighed against each other in a responsible manner.
On the one hand, provision of mobile broadband networks across the board is a basic requirement that is in the interests of European citizens, but, on the other hand, development in the area of public and private broadcasting must be taken into consideration as an important instrument for cultural diversity and the provision of information.
We must set the correct course for technical development and for Europe â€™ s position in the area of digital information technology and cultural diversity.
