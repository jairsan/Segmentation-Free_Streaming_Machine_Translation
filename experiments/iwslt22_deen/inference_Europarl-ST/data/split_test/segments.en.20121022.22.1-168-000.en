Mr President, last Wednesday, the Nordseewerke shipyard in Emden had to file for bankruptcy because, to its surprise, a guarantee by the Lower Saxon Land Government was not extended.
That undertaking, with 700 skilled jobs, is in the process of transforming from a shipyard to a supplier of offshore wind energy.
And it is now thought that this undertaking can be saved by a large loan and that the jobs can also be saved, for the 700 SIAG and Nordseewerke workers have already had to accept substantial cuts in their pay.
That is why I ask the Commission to take a favourable and also an early look at this procedure, to ensure that these 700 jobs are not put at risk, because they are needed in order to organise the energy revolution and sustainable energy on the seas of Europe.
Please do not let the workers there suffer from the Land government â€™ s poor crisis management.
