Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, absent representatives of the Council, perhaps you are following the debate on the European Parliament ’ s videostream, as you clearly have neither the capacity nor the inclination to speak to us live.
In my view, the Council ’ s absence from this debate today shows total disrespect for Parliament.
Instead of shying away from this debate, they should explain why they are intent on refusing to make any improvement in the protection of personal data in the police and judicial spheres by means of a directive.
We know that the police and judiciary have been an El Dorado for violations of data protection for years, and not only in relation to SWIFT. Violation has now become routine; for example, the personal data of citizens who participate in anti-Nazi demonstrations are unlawfully collected and stored.
We need the same standards of protection in the public and the private sphere and in relation to the police and judiciary. This is essential in order to protect civil rights.
The Council expects this House to collaborate constructively on regulations of relevance to data protection, such as EU-PNA, but we expect the same of the Council.
I therefore urge the Council to stop stalling on data protection at last!
