Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the financial transaction tax is certainly not identical to the Tobin tax that has been talked about and debated for many years, but I think it incorporates essential elements of the Tobin tax.
It can at least be said to take on board the idea that the financial markets should participate in the tax system and, above all, should share in bearing the costs of the crisis.
I think that sends a very important message to the financial markets.
However, it is also an important message to send to our citizens, to our electorate.
There have been a great many actions, petitions and written pleas to politicians in a wide range of Member States asking for a financial transaction tax to at last be introduced at European level.
I believe that with the majority that we are seeing here in favour of this report and this tax, Parliament has achieved a major success.
While it is undoubtedly not sufficient to stabilise and restrict the markets in the way that may be necessary, I feel it is a really important step that we are taking here.
I would particularly like to urge the Council to take seriously the voices of our citizens, of our electorate, and to work towards this
towards this actually being introduced and not to block the introduction of this tax because of the British position or other positions.
I think it is clear that the citizens of the European Union want this tax, and I think we have a great responsibility here.
It is now up to the Council to take action on this, and I should like to use my speaking time to urge the Council to do everything it can to ensure that this tax is now actually introduced and becomes a reality.
