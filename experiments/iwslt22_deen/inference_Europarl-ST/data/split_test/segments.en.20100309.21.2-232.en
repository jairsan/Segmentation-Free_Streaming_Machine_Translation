I understand.
Mr Almunia was the competent Commissioner.
However, I was asking about interventions on your part, so could you just tell us once again what you did yourself?
Have I understood you correctly, Mr Barroso, that the blame for the Greek crisis lies with the Member States, because they refused to follow your proposals?
Could you please tell us which Heads of Government of which Member States we are talking about?
