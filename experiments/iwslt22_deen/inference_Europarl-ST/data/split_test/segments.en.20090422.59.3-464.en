Mr President, we have a problem with copyright and we have a problem with remuneration for artists.
So we should and we must become proactive and do something here.
However, if we become proactive, then it is important that we react to the challenges of the digital era and not flog dead horses.
Let me explain how I arrived at this image.
The proposal before us actually only honours one single promise, and that is the promise to promote the music industry.
If we were to address what is actually happening with the artists and their income and calculate that, we would arrive at averages
averages that are clearly too low for artists to support themselves and get something out of it.
Moreover, this money does not go directly to artists.
The fund is too small to achieve anything.
An artist with whom I discussed this told me that a redistribution was taking place here between the quick and the dead.
I had to contradict him: it is a redistribution between artists and producers, the music industry, and then only the big names.
All in all, Commissioner, this proposal is not appropriate.
We need to find something better.
We need, for example, to create something like a flat rate.
Even the proposals you make in connection with the ‘ use-it-or-lose-it ’ clause are still theoretical law.
Please can we do something clever and well-founded, just as the artists recommended and requested in our hearing in the Committee on Legal Affairs.
