Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, last week – to my great pleasure as a new Member – in a meeting of the Foreign Policy Committee we heard a talk by Mr
Policy Committee we heard a talk by Mr Makhmalbaf, an Iranian film director, who told us very plainly that before this election Iran had 20% democracy, but after the election, which in his opinion was a sham, there was absolutely no democracy left.
I also agree with this description – it most certainly was a sham election, which, with large-scale electoral fraud, robbed the majority of Iranian people, who had called for change, of this right.
President-in-Office of the Council there is one thing in particular that interests me: in the middle of August the inauguration of the ‘ re-elected ’ Mr Ahmadinejad will take place.
What is currently being discussed in the Council and also in the Member States?
Will the European Union and the Member States be officially represented at this inauguration?
I certainly hope not, as I do not think that there should be any official representation of the European Union or the Member States after this election sham
Member States after this election sham, and as much as I would advocate further dialogue, no one should officially represent the European Union at this inauguration.
What is your position on this?
How is it currently being dealt with?
