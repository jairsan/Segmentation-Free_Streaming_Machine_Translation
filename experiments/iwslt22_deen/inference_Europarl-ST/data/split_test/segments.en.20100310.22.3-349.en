Madam President, it is a question of us, as the European Union, following a clear strategy and preventing a gold or gemstone rush.
Europe must actively involve itself here.
Europe, as a partner, can show strength here by speaking with one voice.
This relates to shipping on and below the water, fisheries, resources in the form of primary energy carriers and raw materials.
In this connection, we need stable and dependable treaties with the other partners in the Arctic.
We need cooperation, not confrontation.
We need dialogue in the field of environmental protection in order to conserve natural resources and nature.
We need dialogue in the field of animal protection in order to conserve the biodiversity, and we need protection and respect for the local inhabitants and their human rights.
If we can implement positive resource management together with our partners in the Arctic, we will have the opportunity to take new political roads here, and it
will also be a first acid test for our common foreign policy â€“ a chance to prove that we, as Europeans, can indeed pursue objectives together.
