Madam President, the new directive will provide a basis for dealing with books, newspapers, works of art, films, pieces of music and television productions that are protected by copyright, but for which the rights holder cannot be identified or cannot be located.
Under the directive, books, films, photographs or other intellectual creations for which no rights holder can be found are to be made available to the public.
This will create a cultural treasure trove.
For us in the Committee on Culture and Education, it was of very particular importance to emphasise the special importance of the diversity of the cultural heritage of the European Union in this legislative initiative.
In the archives of our museums, libraries, publishing houses and broadcasters, countless unused works are to be found which, until now, were not made available purely because the rights holders were unknown.
This directive will change that.
It will make it possible for these cultural assets to be used in future, provided that it is ensured that a diligent search is carried out before publication.
This is a very important point, as it prevents people from breezily declaring that the rights holder just cannot be found.
There is a need, after all, to find a balance between the real, existing rights of the creators of works and the public ’ s need to be able to use works where the rights situation cannot be resolved.
For us, there is a particular focus on the need to ensure that both known and unknown rights holders must continue to be fully protected.
Where rights holders cannot be found, the proposals make it possible to make use of the digitisation of the orphan works.
Projects such as Europeana, and other major European digitisation projects, but also our museums, archives, educational institutions and public broadcasters, will benefit from this arrangement.
In future, however, orphan works in the archives of private publishers must also be made available to the public.
In my view, this draft directive and the compromise that has now been reached really represent a compromise and a first step in the right direction.
I believe that the cultural treasure trove that is up for grabs holds an enormous potential.
We should continue to work on that when we revise the directive in two years ’ time.
