Mr President, we need a revolution in democracy. Mr Barroso, just imagine you
just imagine you were to stand for election in Europe, just you and no other candidate.
What percentage of the votes would you receive? What would the citizens do?
They would probably have listened to you today and seen that you promised everything to everyone.
Hopefully, they would also find out what you did five years ago.
That was when you promised most people a very great deal.
It is a question of comparing what you promised then with what you are promising now and with what can be expected.
I believe that is very, very little.
You represent the old Europe, the botched Europe, the contribution to the financial crisis, as a result of the failure on the part of the Commission, the lack of commitment to climate issues, and so on and so forth.
I would be on the side of the majority of European citizens, because I believe that you would not get more than 10 or 12 or 15% of the votes.
