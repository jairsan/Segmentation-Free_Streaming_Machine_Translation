. Madam President, Commissioner, you have, I believe, just hit the nail on the head, in that we all recognise that we are capable of starting a third industrial revolution in Europe if we truly understand that we need to see sustainability as an industrial opportunity.
You also mentioned resources and that reminded me of something that I completely forgot about today.
I completely forgot about the human resources in my office.
Ms Philipp, if I may say so, you have worked extremely hard on this with marvellous results. You played an absolutely key role in this matter.
For that, I would very much like to thank you.
