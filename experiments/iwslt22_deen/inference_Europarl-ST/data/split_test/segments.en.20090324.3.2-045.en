Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report by Mr van Nistelrooij on the Green Paper and the future form of cohesion policy is certainly one of the most important reports produced by the Committee on Regional Development in recent years.
We agree with the fundamental concept of the Green Paper, which states that the purpose of territorial cohesion is to ensure the polycentric development of the EU
ensure the polycentric development of the EU as a whole, the sustainable development of the territories with their different features and characteristics and, at the same time, the preservation of their diversity.
A more comprehensive system offering gradual help for transition regions which exceed the threshold of 75% of gross domestic product must be established in the next
exceed the threshold of 75% of gross domestic product must be established in the next programming period, so that these regions have a clear status and can develop in greater security.
Mrs Krehl â€™ s report on the obstacles to the use of Structural Funds rightly lists the major problems faced by applicants in claiming Structural
claiming Structural Funds, such as excessive bureaucracy, too many complex regulations or the slow and cumbersome centrally managed administration in the Member States.
Many recommendations are made to the Commission about the effective measures which need to be taken to remove these obstacles.
I would like to single out two of these measures and reinforce them.
Firstly, project leaders must currently keep project documents for a period of 10 years in order to be able to produce them for inspection by the Commission.
This regulation imposes an excessive bureaucratic burden on small projects in particular.
It is right that this period should now be reduced to three years. Secondly, the evaluation criteria used by the Commission for innovative projects are causing significant problems.
The same criteria should not be applied to innovative projects as to other projects.
It is essential that a different process is used in this case.
