Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the rescue packages were intended to protect EU Member States from insolvency.
However, they are overwhelming citizens with brutal austerity programmes and allowing the perpetrators to get off scot-free. On top of that, the Commission is now interfering in national wage policy, too.
Mr Hahn, it is quite absurd and it brings tears to my eyes when I hear formal arguments like yours that this is not at all intended to be a socio-political measure.
Such a position is utterly unacceptable. Wage policy is not the business of the EU. This policy on the part of the Commission is at complete odds with the idea of this European Union.
The EU was never intended to be about competition in wages and social dumping.
This Commission policy talks about the inflexibility of wages, which is to be reduced.
It states that wages should reflect market conditions.
This is like a blind man describing an elephant. People who write such things have no understanding of collective agreement systems.
They interfere in free collective bargaining and reduce the much talked-about autonomy of the social partners and the social dialogue to absurdity.
I would like to make it clear that this Parliament is called on to ensure that the autonomous collective agreement policy is retained, to protect the social dialogue and to prevent the further dismantling of social security.
We need measures to prevent a counterproductive austerity policy, not punitive measures.
