Mr President, Mrs Göncz is an MEP in the same group as me.
You can be against Ferenc Gyurcsány, or for him.
You can disapprove of Mrs Göncz, or you can support her.
It is absolutely up to every individual to decide for themselves, freely and independently, whether they are for or against a given person ’ s political conviction.
The debate that we are holding here concerns the last dictatorship left in Europe.
We are holding it about one of the most brutal and bloodiest dictators on the continent of Europe.
I find it totally unacceptable for a freely elected, democratic Member of my group to be compared with a bloodthirsty dictator.
I feel that Parliament must also rebuff this, especially when it comes from the representative of a party that is characterised by a hate and persecution that it bestows on the Roma minority in Hungary that is unparalleled across Europe.
If there is one person here who does not have the right to criticise Mrs Göncz, then that person is Mrs Morvai.
