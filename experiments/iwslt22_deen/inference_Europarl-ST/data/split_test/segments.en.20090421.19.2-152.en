Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think that, during this parliamentary term, we have together made some progress with regard to the discharge procedure for the European institutions.
However, I regret that it has taken so long, because in principle we have only now finished what was outlined at the time of the resignation of the Commission in 1999 – in other words 10 years ago.
This shows that we quite definitely need to make improvements to our procedures and methods of working and to ensure that the necessary transparency appears quicker when it comes to citizens discovering what their taxes are used for.
I would particularly like to thank Mr Casaca, with whom I had the honour of working on the discharge of Parliament for the Group of the European People ’ s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats.
I very much regret that a fellow Member who has made very many comments in the press on various matters relating to the European Parliament is not participating either in the debates or the votes in committee nor in the debate here in plenary.
This is something I want to say very clearly at this point, so that it is retained and remains for posterity! We know very well that there have been and still are a number of problems here
there have been and still are a number of problems here, and it is the MEPs who are here now who over the last five years have ensured that the necessary reforms are made in numerous places in the interests of the MEPs.
For this, I offer my very sincere thanks to everyone. We have done what we needed to do and we have not released all of the information widely via the media and then not participated.
Thank you for your positive cooperation.
