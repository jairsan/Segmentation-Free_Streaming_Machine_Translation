Mr President, at the beginning of March, political prisoners Mikhail Khodorkowski and Platon Lebedev were transferred from Chita, in Siberia, to Moscow, in order to once again face untenable accusations.
The first public hearing is due to take place on 31 March.
The fifth round of human rights consultations between the EU and Russia was due to take place on the same day.
The Russians have now deferred these important talks indefinitely.
Russia is thus making it very clear just how little it values human rights.
Rather than administering justice, the judicial system continues to serve the purpose of eliminating opponents of the regime, and the wool is being pulled over the eyes of the EU.
