. Mr President, there are enormous human rights problems in Central America, as well as in Peru and Colombia.
As Members of the European Parliament, we cannot simply close our eyes to this fact.
We intend examining the road map for human rights demanded by Parliament in the case of Columbia and Peru once it has been drawn up.
This must have substance and be binding and must cover initial results, such as the prosecution of criminals and the safe return of exiles to their country of origin.
Naturally, this road map must be in place before we vote on the agreement.
We, the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance, believe it is right that the Committee on International Trade should call for environmental and social standards in the proposed regulation for the safeguard clauses, rather than just tonnage restrictions for bananas.
This must be confirmed by the trialogue, as otherwise the regulation is worthless.
The EU needs to do a lot more to keep a close eye on the situation at local level and, above all, the impact on the local population.
That is why the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance is also calling for a proper impact assessment prior to all negotiations, examining not only the economic impact on the EU, but also the impact on human rights.
