Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, visitors, the cultural diversity of Europe is an important commodity that we need to preserve and even develop in future.
In order to make that possible, we need to face the challenges of the digital age not only in the information and knowledge society, but also, above all, in the cultural and creative sector.
Cultural diversity is not just an ideal; it is also a significant economic factor.
Around five million people in the European Union are employed in the cultural sector.
That equates to around 2.5% of the total population.
The cultural sector is a growth sector that is developing faster than many other areas in the economy.
The development of information and communications technologies is driven just as much by the content offered by the cultural sector as the nature and quality of that content have been changed and developed through technology.
We therefore need a framework for the cultural and creative sector within which it can develop sustainably in the face of the challenges of the digital age.
We need a modern, accessible and legally certain system in which everyone can develop on an equal footing.
The cultural and creative sector is a driver for Europe.
We therefore need to pay some attention to this area, including when it comes to education and training.
We need to provide young people with cultural and creative skills â€“ including within the scope of lifelong learning.
However, we also need to improve the business skills of our creative artists and to give them a sound media grounding in new technologies.
We need to create a framework within which those engaged in the cultural sector can safeguard their livelihoods.
We therefore need to work intensively on the issues of copyright, social security and intellectual property, but also on open access to information and content, in order to ensure the continued development of the creative and cultural sector in the future in a digital environment and in order to enable us
ensure the continued development of the creative and cultural sector in the future in a digital environment and in order to enable us to retain cultural diversity and the cultural heritage of Europe as a significant distinguishing feature of the European Union.
