Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what should worry us and make us panic is not simply the sheer numbers of unemployed young people in Europe, but the way this is developing.
Between 2008 and 2011, the number of unemployed young people rose by 26.5%, according to the International Labour Organisation.
It is this development that necessitates urgent measures, for we are not only cutting off an entire generation from the labour market – we are cutting off an entire generation from a future worth living.
If we allow our young people to feel completely useless, it is no wonder that young people are turning away from this EU because they have no reasonable prospect of work or life opportunities.
I would really urge you, Commissioner, to ensure that the measures decided on to counter this are initiated. I can see some things being done, but please ensure that the many years ’ of mental doldrums are not now replaced by a flurry of activity.
When I read that the Commission is starting a programme under which young people will now be given financial assistance if they apply for a job abroad, then we are starting a migration circus that will not solve the problem.
On the contrary, it will be counterproductive; because technicians, doctors, engineers and care workers will then be poached by the richer countries that are not in this crisis.
In this crisis, which is the cause of this development, what we need are offensive measures; namely, the phasing out of this lunatic austerity that is stifling Europe ’ s economy.
We need a targeted growth policy, we need a strengthening of domestic purchasing power, and public investments in education, research and alternative energies.
That would be the right approach.
Combined with European subsidies, it would then be possible actually to develop an integrated concept that creates some prospects for the lives of young people.
I have one final comment to make, and that is that this youth unemployment cannot be reconciled with the nonsense about wanting to raise the retirement age to 70.
We need a different policy here that allows young people access to the labour market.
That is what I am urgently calling for.
