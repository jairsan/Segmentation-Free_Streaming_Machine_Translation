Madam President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, one could wonder what we have actually now achieved after a year spent in discussions, debates and many sessions in the trialogue, and I could have certainly imagined doing something nicer than spending my time there.
One year on from the European elections, when we announced in public how we wanted to bring the finance markets into line, we are now at a point where our success rate ranges from very little to none at all.
The problem has already been explained.
We are dealing with markets which operate globally nowadays.
Member States still believe that they can use their national supervisory structures to apply rules in this environment.
The fact that this did not work was not what actually triggered the financial crisis, but it contributed to Europe being affected by it as well.
This is why I would ask when this realisation, which is often mentioned in grandiose speeches, will be converted into political action, where it is suddenly about protecting stock exchange centres and banking structures and no longer about protecting citizens.
This is the task to which we have committed ourselves as the European Parliament. I hope that Member States will commit themselves to this task, too, because we share the responsibility for implementing proper supervision regulations for citizens, which will ensure that individuals ’ savings are also permanently secure.
I would of course hope – and I am now addressing the Commissioners – that every effort will now be made by the Commission so that we can achieve a good outcome as quickly as possible, for the benefit of people living in Europe.
