Madam President, Commissioner, thank you for your detailed comments.
However, these detailed statements do not answer the questions that were put.
The point of the questions was to ask whether it has been ensured that results will be achieved quickly.
The industries that we want to exclude from these additional burdens, or in which we want to bring about fair conditions, need planning certainty.
That is why we need decisions to be made soon.
We need rapid decisions that can be relied on and we also need clear statements from the Commission.
This process has already been extremely drawn out.
We were all aware that it is a highly complex process that we have embarked upon, but when we accepted the compromise on the Emissions Trading Directive, we said that a condition of our acceptance was
condition of our acceptance was that relief would be provided for those European industries that were excessively burdened as a result, because otherwise they would not be able to compete with other areas of the world.
I expect the basis upon which we acted at the time, the grounds for the decision in Parliament, with the Council and the Commission, to be realised as intended.
I am slightly worried that, along the way, the group of industries concerned is getting smaller and smaller, that – if I may say so – our perspective is getting meaner and meaner, that more and more areas are being excluded.
We are not just talking about steel; the aluminium industry is also affected – you know that – along with many other areas, such as chemicals and so on, and we are talking about the fact that what was the political basis for the decision at the time is not being implemented in practice.
As you rightly pointed out, Commissioner, the situation of industries in Europe has not got any easier since this decision; rather, it has got more difficult.
We are in a completely new situation and competition is much fiercer.
We all struggling with it and giving fine speeches here about how these industries are very important for the future development of Europe.
There were more smart speeches given here yesterday.
I expect – Parliament expects – that what was agreed then will now be implemented, for the benefit of the industries – no, not the industries, but rather the people who work in these enterprises, for jobs and thus for Europe ’ s future opportunities.
