Mr President, Mr Barroso, thank you for your kind descriptions of your debate.
It did not answer my question, however.
I will therefore try to be more precise this time, and I would ask you to be very precise in your answer.
Did Mrs Malmström tell you during the debate in the Commission before the College made its decision that there was a risk that Parliament would reject the text that you are now presenting as an agreement?
Or did Mrs Malmström say to you: ‘ We will get a parliamentary majority with this text ’?
Let me repeat my question very precisely. Did Mrs Malmström say: ‘ We will get a parliamentary majority for this text ’ or did she say: ‘ With this text it is uncertain whether we will get a parliamentary majority ’?
I would be grateful if you could answer precisely.
