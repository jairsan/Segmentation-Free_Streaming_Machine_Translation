Mr President, Commissioner, to be honest, your answer disappointed me a little.
You obviously want to stick to the old system of complex negotiations with each country, which will again mean that there will be no greater access to literature, in other words, no further opportunities for the blind and visually impaired.
I find this doubly sad because the European Union is now blocking a forward step in the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO), while many other partners to the treaty would be prepared to move forward.
We are missing a huge opportunity here.
You are not campaigning in favour of more rights for authors, but rather against people who are to be guaranteed equal access to cultural assets under the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, so that they can also fully share in these cultural assets.
I am calling on you to remove these barriers and to sign up to a binding treaty.
