Mr Leichtfried, I would like to ask you a question. Are you in favour of us discussing the modernisation of copyright regulations on a European level?
Or are you completely opposed to any form of intellectual property?
How do you think that the e-Commerce Directive should be adapted to changing circumstances in future?
From what you have said, I understand that you are totally opposed to a debate on these issues and do not support intellectual property.
Is that correct?
