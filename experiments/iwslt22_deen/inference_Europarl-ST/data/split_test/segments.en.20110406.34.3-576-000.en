Mr President, I would like to ask the representatives of the Council and the Commission why they believe that they have to address this subject using speech bubbles.
I do not think that we are helping anyone by not making a specific statement to the effect that in the run-up to the Istanbul conference, the Member States and the European Union
the European Union must finally meet their obligations in full and that we cannot tolerate Member States increasingly shirking their responsibilities.
It is unacceptable that one billion people still live in hunger, most of them in the least developed countries (LDCs), in other words, the poorest countries in the world.
It is also unacceptable that the majority of our development aid does not go to support and develop agriculture. The proportion used for this purpose has fallen rapidly in recent years, while one billion people go hungry.
I am slowly beginning to think that saying that we hope the LDCs will become more resistant to shocks is a cynical approach.
I am calling on you to take specific measures to address the problems and to make concrete commitments to provide the LDCs with real help.
