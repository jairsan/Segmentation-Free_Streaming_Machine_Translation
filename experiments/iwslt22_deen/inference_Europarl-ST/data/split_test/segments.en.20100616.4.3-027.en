Madam President, unfortunately, my painful illness has so far prevented me from speaking out as clearly to our international audience as I have done in the past on other European topics.
I have one minute, Mr Barroso.
This is an historic period for you.
As far as the financial markets are concerned, you will be measured on whether you succeed in resolving one of the most urgent issues, in other words, introducing regulations which actually close the loopholes.
As things currently stand, everything that we hear from the Commission and that has so far been said in Parliament does not preclude that from happening.
If none of the necessary improvements are made, you will go down in history as someone who watched the house burning down and made no attempt to find anything to put the fire out or even any new building materials.
My second point concerns capital. If you do not succeed in abolishing this disastrous, devastating system of conduit banks, rather than just keeping it in check, you
will be depriving the real economy and billions of people throughout the world not only of their own economic basis for action, but also their confidence in everything which we call democracy.
This will mean that China and the totalitarian states, which are making sure that their banks are under control, will suddenly be in a better position than the European Union.
My third point is that, of course, we need a system which keeps systemic risks to a minimum. The ‘ too big to fail ’ issue can be resolved with progressive tax regulations which will require a bank simply to close when it gets too big.
