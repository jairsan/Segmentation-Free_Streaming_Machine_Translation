Mr President, I very much welcome the strategy set out in the White Paper, which will enable us to tackle the causes of poor nutrition and obesity and the diseases with which they are associated.
Unfortunately, in Europe's food policy, whether we are talking about nutrient profiles or food labelling, or indeed in some aspects of the White Paper, we tend to resort to a very one-sided approach.
We generally try to resolve Europe's problems through product policy.
In my view, assuming that there are good and bad foods is fundamentally the wrong approach.
As many of the amendments show, this is not the case.
There are only good and bad, or balanced and unbalanced, types of diet.
That should be our approach.
There are many reasons why people eat the wrong type of diet.
Addressing this problem by attempting to steer consumers in a particular direction with product labelling or even by introducing advertising bans or regulations or applying different VAT rates, will not bring us closer to our desired objective.
I do not want to pre-empt the debate on the Food Labelling Directive, but I do believe that whatever action we take here should be guided by the principle that we should be motivating consumers to think about their eating habits.
Traffic-light labelling – which is supposed to make the consumer stop and think whether he or she is about to choose a good or a bad product – is an approach which patronises consumers rather educating them and raising awareness.
I would like to see a more balanced approach, along with the recognition that pursuing a solely product policy-oriented approach will not take us very far.
