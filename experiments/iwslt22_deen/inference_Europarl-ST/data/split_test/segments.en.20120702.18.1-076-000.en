Mr President, a report about a traffic accident at the weekend involving a lorry driver who fell asleep at the wheel due to exhaustion and drove into a roadside ditch has reaffirmed my view, once again, that it is absolutely necessary
a clear and consistent regulation of driving and rest periods and their monitoring by means of a digital tachograph for us, for road safety, but also for those involved themselves.
The digital tachograph involves a certain degree of innovation, it brings with it new problems, but also old ones.
The new problems come in the shape of new opportunities to manipulate the device, which we need to tackle from a technical point of view.
The old problems are the ones that we can already observe in various Member States in connection with inspection or a lack thereof.
The new rules that we are now putting in place must pay considerable attention, in my view, to the following issues. First of all, a rest period must not automatically be commenced every time that no journey is recorded.
This is because many drivers have to load and unload, and that is, of course, also to be regarded as working time.
The second problem is that the records of speed have been removed from the dossier.
I think that is a mistake, as here, too, there are major risks of accidents.
We also want weight sensors and we want an anonymous fraud-reporting hotline that can be followed up.
I will be tabling a motion for animal transport checks to be incorporated into the regulation.
I think this is important, as it also has to be a key part of our legislation.
