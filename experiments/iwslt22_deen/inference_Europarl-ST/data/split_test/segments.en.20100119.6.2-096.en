Madam President, it seems to me to be a little symptomatic for the EU in general, but also for Parliament in particular, that we should have knee-jerk debates about situations in certain countries that are in no way new.
Unfortunately, it is very often the case that overnight events lead to us here in Parliament spouting out waves of political demands that I sometimes find somewhat dubious.
I think that it does not give a good impression of us if a failed bomb attack on an aeroplane only leads us to a general debate on Yemen.
We should be clear that it would be fitting to consider a strategy for how to deal with this situation.
I also think that the situation in Yemen requires a precise analysis, specifically with regard to the fact that this is a failed state in which the government does not have control of large parts of the country We should analyse for ourselves what risks this involves for Europe.
The risks appear to be that terrorists are trained there and the risks also appear to relate to the Yemeni coast, where piracy is clearly taking place.
We – and perhaps Baroness Ashton, also – must consider what we can do to counter these risks.
As I see it, the main question might well be: how can we bolster the Yemeni Government so that it can regain control of the country and thus contain these risks?
All the other debates about the long-term building-up of the country also need to be held, of course, but I do not think that there is really any point in us putting forward a catalogue of demands clean across all political areas – from the freedom of the media to women ’ s rights – here in Parliament at this point, or that we will be taken seriously if we do so.
Doing so will not achieve our goal in Yemen, so instead, we should concentrate on what tangible assistance we can provide in the current situation in order to solve an urgent problem.
