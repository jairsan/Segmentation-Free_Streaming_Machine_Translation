Mr President, this is a central debate about the character of the European Union.
The choice is between the market and social policy.
The Commission â€™ s current ideas about the future of the cohesion policy are unacceptable.
The structural funds must be strengthened and not weakened.
Europe must do more and not less to overcome economic and social differences in development.
I would like to say quite openly that the renationalisation even of parts of the current cohesion policy would have a serious impact on disadvantaged regions, including those in Germany and, in particular, eastern Germany.
After the last phase of enlargement of the European Union, the differences between the regions in the Union have increased.
In addition, it is important to me that, in particular, socio-economic requirements in the regions which are just above the eligibility threshold of 75% of the EU average GDP per head are recognised.
The sudden removal of subsidies after 2013 would be devastating for these regions.
Of course, it is extremely important for specific subsidies for towns to be increased by the European Union
important for specific subsidies for towns to be increased by the European Union, as this is where the major potential for the economy and finance lies, because the towns have been particularly hard hit by the crisis.
I would like to say one last word about the border regions.
As a Member of Parliament from eastern Germany, I know that we need to invest and achieve a great deal there.
I am very concerned that the Commission will fail us in this respect.
