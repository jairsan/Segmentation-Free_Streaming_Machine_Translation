. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it goes without saying that we support helping people with rare diseases.
That said, Amendment 15 is completely unacceptable from an ethical point of view.
There must never again be a debate in Europe about whose life is worth living and whose not.
There must be no political and social pressure on parents in Europe to consciously decide against having a disabled child.
The selection of embryos would represent an opening of the ethical floodgates.
For that reason we must reject this amendment. It is not enough just to remove the word ‘ eradicate ’, which is actually, it is sad to say, in line with fascist language use.
Doing so would mean that we would still be faced with the selection of embryos.
It would be insufferable if this amendment and its idea of selecting embryos were to become a stepping stone to a new ethics in Europe.
We must stand up resolutely against genetic discrimination.
Amendment 15 must therefore be rejected in its entirety. Otherwise, our group will, unfortunately, be forced to come out against this report even though the rest of it is highly positive.
