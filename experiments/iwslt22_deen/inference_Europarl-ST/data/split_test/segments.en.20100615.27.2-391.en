Mr President, Mr Barroso, following on from the questions put by my fellow Member, Mr Weber, did Commissioner Malmström inform the College that there are great concerns in this House regarding the current state of negotiations?
Is the Commission aware that what it has resolved today is undoubtedly not what Parliament considers to be sufficient progress?
Do you realise, Mr President, that you have adopted something today that, if implemented in this way, will result in people employed by private companies such as Swift having greater rights of control than officials of the European Union?
Did Mrs Malmström explain this to you?
If so, how could you have decided this?
If not, why did Mrs Malmström not make you aware of it?
