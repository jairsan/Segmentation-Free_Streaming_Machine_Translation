Madam President, I believe it is important that we do not use the national tax systems to work against the internal market.
This is essential particularly in the case of cross-border services which is where equal treatment is needed.
There is currently a negative example of this in Hungary, where retrospective price limits are being used as a form of crisis tax.
This is not acceptable and it will have a serious impact on the financial, insurance and business sectors and also the energy industry.
I hope that the same thing will not happen in future in the field of healthcare services.
I would like to ask Mr Orb√°n to re-evaluate these regulations, because they are in complete opposition to the concept of the internal market.
