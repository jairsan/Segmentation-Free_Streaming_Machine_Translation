Mr President, Commissioner, you are right, the railway system is a very safe system when compared to other forms of transport.
Alongside many positive elements, however, liberalisation has also brought with it a degree of poorer safety in the form of the fragmentation of individual companies, the separation of infrastructure and operations, the outsourcing of maintenance work and the leasing of materials and staff.
In my opinion, it must be ensured that the national safety authorities issue their safety certificates and authorisations in accordance with what is laid down by the European Railway Agency (ERA).
Are there adequate controls?
Is it ensured, for example, that the training of the staff, the certifications and the working conditions are properly monitored?
What is the situation, in this regard, with respect to the introduction of a standardised Community certification?
What is the situation with regard to the European train driver ’ s licence?
The efforts with regard to the European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS) must also be redoubled.
The recent implementation plan that you referred to must be binding and must not be delayed due to financial or national considerations.
The efforts relating to the introduction of the Technical Specifications for Interoperability (TSI) must be continued and extended.
This would represent huge progress, particularly in terms of the standardisation of materials, and would provide a higher degree of safety in relation to material maintenance.
Many of the most recent railway accidents and near-misses have been due to maintenance failings.
The intensity, in particular, is being neglected on cost grounds, and maintenance intervals are being lengthened.
What is the situation with regard to a Europe-wide certification system for maintenance works?
I believe that everything possible must be done to prevent each individual Member State from turning back to its old rules and acting independently and in diverging ways.
The border crossings between the individual Member States, in particular, represent a safety risk.
How does the Commission intend to overcome this problem in the short term?
I would also like to ask you to ensure that, when you make your evaluation, you do not forget the social aspects – they need to be taken into account.
