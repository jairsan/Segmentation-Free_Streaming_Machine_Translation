Madam President, I unconditionally support the Commission â€™ s aim of creating a legal framework for the coordinated introduction and use of intelligent transport systems in the field of road transport.
My personal long-standing fight for the mass introduction of eCall, the electronic emergency callout system, brings the urgency of this home to me almost daily, and intelligent transport systems can do so much more.
They contribute towards environmental sustainability, improved efficiency, enhanced safety and non-discriminatory competitiveness in road passenger and freight traffic.
They also support co-modality, including by developing interfaces with other modes of transport such as rail, waterways and aviation, which started to incorporate intelligent transport systems a long time ago.
All this cannot be achieved by the Member States alone; it can only be achieved as a Community task.
Intelligent transport systems based on EU-wide compulsory minimum underlying standards and specifications improve the environment for innovation and create planning security, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises.
I welcome in particular the planned open, vehicle-integrated platform for intelligent transport system services.
The action plan at last includes a timetable for the introduction of individual systems a) for safety in road transport, such as ESP and eCall, b) for continuity in traffic management; for example, information on congestion charges or parking management reduces the number of cars driving round looking for a parking place, c) to
on congestion charges or parking management reduces the number of cars driving round looking for a parking place, c) to use road, traffic and travel data in real time, which will be an asset both to professional lorry drivers and everyone else using the roads.
The directive sets out detailed requirements for the compulsory and coordinated introduction of standard intelligent transport systems throughout the EU and their application in the Member States.
It also safeguards the use of personal data.
But beware, the introduction of intelligent transport systems will cost a lot of money, because infrastructures and vehicles will need to be fitted with the necessary information and communications technology.
We still know too little about whether potential users are willing or able to pay.
