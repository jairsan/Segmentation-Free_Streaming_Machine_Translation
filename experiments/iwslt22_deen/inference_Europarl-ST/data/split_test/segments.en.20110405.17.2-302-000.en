. Mr Barroso, you are a very clever man, however you have not answered my question.
I will therefore ask you again: when Mr Oettinger says ‘ We suspect that some of the plants currently connected to the network will not survive the stress tests ’, I interpret this to mean that you are aware that safety at these plants is so poor that they will not meet the criteria.
So why not intervene straight away?
I believe that this is a real and present danger.
