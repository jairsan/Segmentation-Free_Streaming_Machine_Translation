Madam President, Mr Kallas, ladies and gentlemen, I very much welcome the result of the conciliation procedure.
When the regulation is implemented, bus and coach passengers, including those with reduced mobility, will have the same high level of protection that applies on other forms of transport. In addition
, the regulation guarantees a high overall level of consumer protection and takes into consideration the fact that this transport sector consists mainly of small and medium-sized companies.
The extreme requirements which would have made bus transport almost impossible have been removed, together with those that would have excluded the majority of the Member States from the scope of the regulation.
Bus and coach services which benefit the majority of citizens must also provide a high quality service for disabled people and people with reduced mobility.
They should have the right to receive help and this must be provided free of charge in the interests of social integration.
