President Klaus reacted to today ’ s decision in the Czech Senate, which we sincerely welcome and on which I offer my hearty congratulations, by, amongst other things, claiming that the Treaty of Lisbon was dead, because it had been rejected in the Irish referendum.
He is a political zombie launching an attack against the majority decisions of his own Parliament and the Senate and confirming his unfortunate and sectarian attitude in other policy areas as well.
Fortunately, after the positive votes, he is merely making himself look very silly.
We, the Greens, have a positive and constructive attitude towards the process of European integration, with critical comments, of course, where necessary.
Once again, my warmest thanks to the Czech Senate, the Czech Parliament and the Czech Government.
