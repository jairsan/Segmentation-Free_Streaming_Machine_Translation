Mr President, there is a German rhyme: which tells of regional pride in a brewery, and this demonstrates a problem that we have created today.
If this brewery or its distributor is 107 kilometres away from where I live, then in future, it will no longer be able to supply me with its products unless it buys a new tachograph and complies with new red tape.
That is why I voted against this resolution today, because in my view, we should not be overburdening our small and medium-sized enterprises. There are many points that we have managed to incorporate which were positive.
After all, it was planned that a radius of just 50 kilometres should be accepted for regional suppliers.
The Commission was being quite absurd there.
A distance of 100 kilometres may be just about feasible.
However, what if the distance is more than this?
I therefore consider it to be excessive.
One final aspect: as a representative of an employees â€™ organisation in the German CSU party, I would also say that this regulation represents complete control of workers.
Why?
It is because the entire working day of those distributing construction materials or drinks from the breweries is completely controlled via GPS.
For data protection reasons, too, therefore, I feel that what we have decided today is highly questionable, and I emphasise once again why I voted against it.
