Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, particularly now, in a period of crisis, it is becoming clear what kind of European Union we really want.
Do we want a union where the glue that binds us together is our conviction that people in the Member States of the European Union should not be forced to live in poverty?
Do we believe that we have a joint responsibility for combating poverty and social exclusion?
Or are we choosing a union like the one just outlined by the Members from the far-right group in Parliament?
Sometimes, I think that the attitude of the Member States and, in particular, of some of their governments is bringing us dangerously close to the vision of the European Union that has just been formulated by those on the extreme right-wing.
This means not doing anything jointly or putting in place any joint instruments or indicators. Wherever possible, the wording is vague.
This is made very, very clear in many of the points in the report. I believe that we need to take a much stronger approach.
We need to bring an immediate end to the sell-off of public assets and of social security systems.
We need minimum social and environmental standards.
This winter, we must not allow people to be thrown out on the street, or deported, or ultimately even to freeze to death, because of rising energy prices.
We have a joint responsibility in this respect, in other words, the responsibility of the European Union.
We must stand up for this and not for the nationalist claptrap that we have heard from those on the right.
