() Madam President, the last time that there was such a demonstration of opinion during a visit by a Head of State or Government, the President of this House intervened very strongly.
On that occasion it related to a matter that was also of concern to him personally, namely the Treaty of Lisbon.
Today, when the President, the sovereign elected President of a country, is speaking and is interrupted and hassled to such an extent by the socialists, the President does nothing.
Do you know what this is?
This is not democracy, this is despotism. I demand that the appropriate measures be taken.
