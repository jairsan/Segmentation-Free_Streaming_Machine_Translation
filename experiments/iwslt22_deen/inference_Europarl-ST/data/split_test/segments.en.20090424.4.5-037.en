Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I very much welcome the draft report by Mr Schnellhardt and would like to thank him for his fine work.
After the numerous crises in recent years in connection with products of animal origin that pose a risk to human and animal health, a comprehensive statutory regulation is essential.
A revision of the current regulation was necessary.
Now, as before, we need to ensure a high degree of safety.
Although we essentially support the report, there are a few points which give me cause for concern.
Many points in the regulation have been made less stringent and thus make trade in animal by-products somewhat easier.
Let me give some examples of what I am talking about. It is permitted to use certain Category 1 material in pet food.
Category 2 or 3 material may, irrespective of the risk associated with it, be disposed of more easily, under official supervision, if there are only small quantities of waste per week.
The risk associated with animal by-products of any category is only partly determined by its quantity.
It remains the case that it is the European Commission that will enact the implementing regulation and, like its predecessor, the draft contains a lot of authorisations for the Commission.
This means that the Commission can lay down comprehensive and fundamental regulations for handling animal by-products in the comitology procedure, with the result that Parliament – as is unfortunately often the case – is excluded.
