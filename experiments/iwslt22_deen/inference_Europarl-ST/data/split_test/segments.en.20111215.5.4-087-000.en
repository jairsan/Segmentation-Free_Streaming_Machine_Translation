Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to join in thanking our rapporteur and all those who worked on the report because this is certainly not a routine task, even if this is the fortieth time we have dealt with competition policy on the basis of a report from the Commission.
I would like to thank the Commissioner for his very comprehensive presentation â€“ 2010 was, of course, the first year in which you had full responsibility for competition policy.
Turning to something you mentioned yourself, I would like to ask that some practices in the area of public aid in the banking sector should be eradicated because the
should be eradicated because the new stress tests required by the European banking supervision system indicate a need for further recapitalisation for the banks.
I do not believe that it will contribute anything to the stability of the banking system if we still have a large number of unresolved or outstanding old cases on the one hand
have a large number of unresolved or outstanding old cases on the one hand, while new cases are being created on the other because pressure is increasing to raise the equity capital quota accordingly, particularly in the area of private banks.
Hence my urgent plea to you, Commissioner, to find a swift solution that will help stabilise the banking sector so that it can withstand the challenges of the international environment.
The second major issue, the control of mergers, will continue to concern us increasingly in the years ahead.
Here, too, I can only urge you to continue on the clear and transparent path taken by the Commission to date within the framework of merger control.
It is in the interests of all involved, particularly the consumer, that we should ensure that competition is possible in the area of merger control, whether in larger or other structures, which is not for me to judge.
With this in mind, I would like to thank all those who have been involved. I hope, Commissioner, that we will find a solution soon, particularly in the banking sector.
