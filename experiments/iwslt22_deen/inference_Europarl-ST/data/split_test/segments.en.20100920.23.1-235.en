Mr President, property – whether intellectual or physical – is a cornerstone of the market economy.
It is therefore important that we consider how we regulate this matter with a high degree of mutual consensus.
In any case, we need a one-stop shop.
It must become easier for consumers, the self-employed and small and medium-sized enterprises to acquire corresponding licences in this regard.
The availability of EU-wide licences for intellectual property rights is particularly important.
We need an internal market for intellectual property.
Above all, we also need the original language to be available throughout the whole of Europe.
Every language is an important cultural product and it ought to be possible for licences that are granted for one language to apply throughout Europe and therefore be capable of being used by all citizens.
We need interoperability and technical neutrality in order to be able to use this intellectual property accordingly.
Above all, we also need sanctions for those who violate competition and commercial law.
