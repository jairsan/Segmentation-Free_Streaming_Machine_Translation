Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first I would like to thank Mr Leichtfried for an excellent report which contains good, sustainable proposals.
What, in the end, is the issue here?
It is about strengthening transparency, consumer protection, security and coordination, as well as quality control.
I would, however, advise against creating a new authority to deal with these questions.
I take a positive view of the subsidiarity in the report, and it should definitely be retained.
is also very important for me that there should be a clear separation between taxes and charges, and all government tasks – whether fingerprinting and photographing,
, police tasks, fighting terrorism or something similar – must clearly be financed through taxation and not through consumer charges.
If individual states then have a vital interest in taking security measures that go beyond this, then I think that, in this area, they also have the duty to bear the costs.
Whoever orders government-related security measures also pays for them.
I think it is different in the case of technical or personal security, which can certainly be passed on to the passenger, as long as its purpose is clearly declared.
It is worth noting, though, that in the impact assessment that the Commission has put before us, we are talking about a sum of around 0.1% of the total fare for these measures.
We should therefore not start too high.
I believe that we are bringing about a sustainable compromise, including with the Federal Republic of Germany, which has considerable reservations here in the area of subsidiarity.
I would hope that the end result is very close to our proposal.
