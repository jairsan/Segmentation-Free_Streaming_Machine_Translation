Mr President, we have been debating urban transport in the EU for a very long time.
Why exactly?
We are not even competent for it. Competence was originally devised because about 80% of the population live in towns and, due to climate change, we now want to take this on.
Fortunately, thanks to our protests, we were able to reduce these ambitions on the part of the European Commission to an action plan on urban transport.
My thanks to Commissioner Tajani for his insight.
means to support rather than to prescribe, but of course, as an Italian, he knows that better than I, as a German with A-level Latin.
What is important to me, first and foremost, is that our report, Parliament â€™ s report should highlight strict compliance with the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality.
Legislative measures at European level are inadmissible for urban traffic.
Supportive measures are what we are here for.
Brainstorming and encouraging the exchange of best practices make sense.
We do not all need to reinvent the bicycle.
Our towns need bespoke solutions, but they can only be worked out by local players, because only they know what is needed.
Municipalities need to take account of very diverse situations and they therefore need sufficient room for manoeuvre, especially if they are to keep their high streets alive.
They are important to the attractiveness of a town.
It is therefore important not to exclude private cars and to focus more on logistics in the town.
I should therefore like to see more support for research into inner-city retail logistics.
That would take some of the strain off a city.
It is also important to take account of demographic change.
Our society is constantly ageing.
Mobility requirements and residential requirements are changing.
If we want to reduce traffic, people need to be able to obtain their everyday requirements close to home, and that is also a challenge to the retail trade.
Anything else would simply promote the countryside.
We do not need an urban mobility observatory.
It would cost a great deal of money and generate a great deal of paper, which would simply be filed away in Brussels.
