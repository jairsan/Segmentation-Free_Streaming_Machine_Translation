Mr President, democracy needs a revolution, and it is never wrong, Mr Dartmouth, to speak out in favour of transparency, Mr Verhofstadt.
You in particular, in the Swedish Presidency, could be a shining example of this and actually tell us what is
going on in the horse trading for the top posts that is completely unworthy of the European Project and also – Mr Barroso could lead the way on this – with regard to the appointment of the commissioners.
Germany and Austria are a poor example in this regard, but so, unfortunately, are others.
There are qualified people sitting in this Chamber, but they have no chance of being accepted.
Please, now that the Treaty of Lisbon has been adopted, be courageous and honest and admit that we need much clearer, transparent decision-making structures for the Commission and for the top posts.
With so much expertise, it has to be possible to find good people in the European Parliament rather than gathering them from some province or other.
