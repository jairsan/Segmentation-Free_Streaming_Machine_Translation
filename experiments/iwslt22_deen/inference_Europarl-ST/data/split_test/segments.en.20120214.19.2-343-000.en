Mr President, Commissioner, I support the compromise reached in the trialogue, which is aimed at strengthening the negotiating position of dairy farmers in relation to the processing industry, much as I am aware that it does not solve all the problems that dairy farmers currently face in many Member States.
Even 50 years ago, Commission President Sicco Mansholt envisaged preferential measures for the creation of producer communities within the framework of the common agricultural policy.
In my country of Luxembourg, too, the dairy sector is the main pillar of our agricultural sector as a result of the high proportion of grassland.
Our agricultural sector and our farmers long since understood that the best solution is to come together to form a cooperative that takes over the processing of the milk itself.
It was for exactly this reason that, in the Council, five Member States voted against the compromise, which does not live up to the requirement of being a soft-landing instrument.
The Commission has the right of initiative when it comes to proposing legislation, and I would therefore like to call on it to put a legislative proposal to the Council and Parliament this year in order to remedy this clear and costly fault in the system.
A linear reduction up until 2015 in the super levy which is imposed on each litre of milk that exceeds the quota, or the abolition of the fat correction mechanism, could at least reduce the negative effects of the regulation, which is being phased out without detrimental impact on those Member States that are not affected.
This dairy package is also the final report of the high level group that was to bring about a soft landing after the phasing out of milk quotas.
It is astonishing that there is absolutely no mention of milk quotas in this report.
Young and ambitious farmers in Luxembourg and four other Member States who are attempting to prepare for the deregulation of the milk market and aiming to expand their production
aiming to expand their production in order to be able to keep up on the global market after 2015 can only do so by buying additional quotas now, even this close to the abolition of the milk quota system.
This is an unnecessary and enormous additional capital cost which puts them at a disadvantage in comparison with farmers in the other 22 Member States.
