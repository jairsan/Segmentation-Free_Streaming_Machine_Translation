Mr President, Madam Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, there are no new issues in the sphere of budgetary control.
Budgetary control is ongoing, and we would have been gratified to see some progress being made on the issues already on this agenda.
I have five points to make. Firstly, we would urgently appeal for some support for Romania and Bulgaria in establishing the rule of law, the justice system and financial control.
We do not want to be in the same position in two years' time, so this issue is very important to us.
The second issue is the statement of assurance for the budget as a whole after the phased control procedure involving the national courts of audit.
In the last half-year remaining to the Commission, it would be nice if we could achieve some major progress here, or at least agree on a common way forward.
As budget controllers, our expectations are quite modest.
The third point is simplification.
We should be giving the lower tiers of administration in the Member States more help in implementing EU law.
It is clear that they are completely overwhelmed by many areas of EU law, which is why the failure rates are so high.
Fourthly, foreign aid: here, I would like to mention Kosovo in particular and the issue of cooperation with the United Nations.
The Committee on Budgetary Control has been to Kosovo, and I would like to announce at this juncture that Kosovo will be something of an issue when it comes to the discharge of the budget.
In my view, we are falling far short of the opportunities available to the European Union and have considerable ground to make up here.
My fifth point is improving cooperation among the Member States in combating fraud.
Here, we have homework for the ladies and gentlemen of the Council in particular.
In November, the House will be voting on the regulation which provides the legal basis for combating fraud, and we will need to consider how we take this forward if we want to achieve better results in this area.
At least, that is something that we have always agreed on until now.
