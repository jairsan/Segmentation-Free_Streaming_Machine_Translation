Mr President, the regulation that is being discussed today has been largely disregarded by all the committees over a long period.
However, some people in this House have now woken up at the end of the process when the results are on the table.
Some of them have unfortunately not attended the debate, which is a pity because it would have been very interesting to hear their views.
As a former member, I have a clear memory of the spirit of the convention.
It called openly for the European Parliament to be given specific rights in several areas, to ensure that it remained credible in the context of the institutions and with regard to the citizens.
Despite the convention â€™ s demands, nothing was done.
The very tough negotiations which the Belgian Presidency had with the Council were what enabled important progress to be made.
I remember what Mr Lehne said. It was a question of the permanent possibility of investigating whether the Commission had exceeded its powers.
Of course, some of the regulations are not exactly ideal, such as the international trade agreement, but nevertheless I agree with the outcome.
I would like to thank the Belgian Presidency.
It has made every effort to ensure that something was achieved. I would also like to thank the rapporteur, who negotiated sympathetically and intelligently.
