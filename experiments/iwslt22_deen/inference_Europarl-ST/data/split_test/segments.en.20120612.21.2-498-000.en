Mr President, Baroness Ashton, I was also a member of the European Parliament ’ s electoral observation mission to the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and saw for myself how the people arrived at the polling stations and waited to vote full of hopes and expectations for a better future.
We now know that these expectations have not been met.
Although the DRC calls itself democratic, these elections were neither fair nor democratic.
We must speak out forcefully about this, as Ms Nedelcheva has done in her report.
The previous president, Joseph Kabila, claimed that he was the election victor and the opposition was suppressed.
In the east of the country, the violent encounters between government troops and so-called rebels have flared up again and it is unclear whether third countries such as Rwanda are involved.
In every case, it is the civilian population which suffers and which has not been able to live in peace for decades.
The country ’ s wealth is disappearing in a quagmire of corruption and the DRC comes at or near the bottom of the list in all the international rankings.
The international community, and the European Union in particular, must take every opportunity to increase the pressure on the President of the DRC to allow genuine democracy in his country – he will have the chance to do this at the next
do this at the next regional elections – and to prevent the Congolese army from oppressing the civilian population. Instead, criminals who are wanted internationally for crimes against humanity, such as Bosco Ntaganda, must finally be arrested and brought before a court.
Countries throughout the world should give an undertaking not to supply any more arms to the DRC.
Without external pressure, it will not be possible to bring an end to human suffering and poverty in this country.
