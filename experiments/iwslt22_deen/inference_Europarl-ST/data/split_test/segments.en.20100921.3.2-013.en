Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I would like to thank the Members of this House who have worked so hard on this project and, in particular, Mr Vidal-Quadras.
This proves that the European political system is capable of responding to crises and providing useful solutions.
We have seen supply security situations of this kind on several occasions.
As a result, the problem of security of supply has become much clearer.
