Mr Langen, are you aware that we have had Community bonds for quite some time already?
Are you, furthermore, aware that the resolution refers not simply to Eurobonds, but to a wide range of options?
Are you also aware that not all of these options require treaty change?
I find it questionable that you should have picked off generalities about Eurobonds alone once again.
The very differentiation that we have achieved here thanks to Ms Goulard â€™ s sound proposal is not something that we should give up again.
I would like to hear a little more differentiation in your speeches and I am eager to hear what you have to say in that regard.
