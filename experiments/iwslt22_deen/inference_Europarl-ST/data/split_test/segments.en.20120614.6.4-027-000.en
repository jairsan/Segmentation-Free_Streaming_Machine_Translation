Mr President, I would also like to express my sincere thanks to the shadow rapporteurs and the rapporteur.
This report was adopted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety with an absolute majority of 62 votes in favour, no votes against and no abstentions.
This shows that we are actually very much at one with regard to the compromises.
Of course, we must give the greatest priority in this legislative process to the provision of high level consumer protection for the younger members of society, in other words children, who need special consideration.
Gluten intolerance is a problem, particularly in nurseries.
If we look around us – I myself have two children in this age group – we will be aware of the allergies and intolerances that arise, which is why I believe that we have chosen the right approach.
We should continue to discuss this in the second reading, also involving the Council and Commission.
I believe that we will then also achieve positive results.
