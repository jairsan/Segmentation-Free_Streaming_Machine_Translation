Mr President, Mr Hahn, Mr Andor, ladies and gentlemen, I do not need to emphasise how important cohesion and regional policy is for the process of living together and growing together in Europe.
However, I also believe that in future, regional policy and cohesion policy must focus more closely on our cities.
Cities are an important driving force behind development in Europe.
At the same time, they are currently suffering from environmental, economic and social problems.
This is why I have a particular question for Mr Hahn. What opportunities do you think there are for highlighting the urban dimension?
To come to the point, Mr Hahn, you recently indicated during an event which took place in this House that you had a specific percentage of the regional funding in mind which would be reserved for highlighting the urban dimension.
Is this still the case?
If so, what percentage were you thinking of?
