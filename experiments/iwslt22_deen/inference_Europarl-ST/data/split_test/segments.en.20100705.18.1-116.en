Mr President, firstly, I would like to thank Mr Grosch for his in-depth report and for the huge amount of work that he has put into it.
Without a functioning transport system, a Europe without frontiers that separate us will not be possible. In addition, the European economy cannot be successful and is not even conceivable without efficient, future-proof transport systems on land, on water and in the air.
We need a stronger sense of community and less national egoism, in particular, when it comes to environmentally friendly rail transport.
In order to ensure that transport has a sustainable future, all the modes of transport must be prepared to take up the environmental and economic challenges faced by society as a whole.
The report provides valuable pointers in this respect, which indicate the direction that we must move in.
There is only one point on which I do not agree with the report. Establishing a transport fund using cohesion policy money is not something that I can support.
Why is that?
It is true that transport promotes cohesion in Europe. However, a separate fund financed with cohesion policy money would not be able to fulfil the expectations that it would give rise to. It would also apply one-sided pressure on the Cohesion Fund
one-sided pressure on the Cohesion Fund and take too much responsibility away from the Member States, which are specifically required to ensure a sustainable future for transport.
We have just established a special committee in Parliament which will discuss what the European Union Cohesion and Structural Funds will look like in future and we should not prejudge this committee â€™ s work.
Therefore, I am calling on you to vote in favour of the amendment to this report.
In addition, I believe that in the context of sustainability and the future of transport systems, we should also give magnetic levitation technology a chance.
