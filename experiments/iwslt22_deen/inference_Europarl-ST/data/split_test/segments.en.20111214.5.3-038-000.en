Mr President, Mr Tusk, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, I can only agree with all of those who have congratulated the Council Presidency.
Not only were you an honest broker during a difficult time; you were also a European broker.
That was very nice to see during these difficult times in which we are seeing political trends in a number of Member States that suggest to the people that it would be possible to achieve more alone than together.
You focused on what unites us.
It was also very refreshing to see that, with this clear European agenda, you also received the support of the people in Poland on domestic policy matters.
That was not particularly easy in this context.
Therefore, I have the highest respect for what you have achieved.
In this six-month period, we were also able to get a few things under way in the area of financial market regulation.
Allow me to highlight just one area in which I was able to join in the negotiations myself, namely, the question of the regulation of short selling and naked credit default swaps in connection with government bonds, where the Commission did not have the confidence to propose a stringent regulation and with regard to which all the Member States said that we would not succeed
able to join in the negotiations myself, namely, the question of the regulation of short selling and naked credit default swaps in connection with government bonds, where the Commission did not have the confidence to propose a stringent regulation and with regard to which all the Member States said that we would not succeed, and where, thanks to the Polish Presidency, we did succeed in imposing sanctions against a highly speculative instrument and, where necessary, prohibiting it, so that we could help to bring greater stability to the financial markets.
I would particularly like to thank your Finance Minister and the Secretary of State, who got this off the ground during a difficult discussion process between Parliament and the Council.
That is an example that shows that we can do something together in the interests of security and stability in Europe.
I would like to express my sincere thanks for that.
