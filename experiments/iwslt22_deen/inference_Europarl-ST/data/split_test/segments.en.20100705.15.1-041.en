Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, given the small amount of time available, I will restrict myself to discussing the Cancian report.
No one disputes the fact that people travelling on buses and coaches must have passenger rights and, therefore, consumer rights.
However, I would like to emphasise once again the problems that will result for small and medium-sized operators at the moment, in particular, in Germany.
It is not possible to separate local and regional public transport facilities in Germany, especially in rural areas, as they often jointly provide services covering a radius of around 50 km.
My second point is that small and medium-sized operators will not be able to make advance compensation payments regardless of fault.
Until now, the principle of legal liability has proved its worth and has resulted in stable ticket prices.
Thirdly, I do not believe that operators should pay for delays that are not their fault, just as liability should only apply in circumstances for which operators are responsible.
