Madam President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur and also our shadow rapporteur. They have produced a good report.
The most important point for me is that both sides which are currently making life difficult in Bosnia and Herzegovina have come to their senses and are retreating from their extreme positions.
One of these extreme positions involves constantly calling Bosnia and its integrity into question and threatening to hold referendums which will have no impact except to stir up public opinion and generate hatred. The other extreme position is to call into question the basic structure of Dayton.
Does the Dayton Agreement need to be adapted?
Yes.
It has already been modified, but more work needs to be done.
One side is constantly saying that the office of the High Representative must be abolished and I agree with this.
However, the side that is calling for that to happen must prepare the ground for the politicians in the country to be able to take on the responsibility themselves.
This must be our objective, but the politicians must also play their part.
In addition, at the next election, the voters will hopefully elect politicians who are prepared to be responsible for their own country.
