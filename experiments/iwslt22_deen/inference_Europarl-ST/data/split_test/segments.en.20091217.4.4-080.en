Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to raise two points of order and I would like to be able to raise them one after another.
Firstly, I have a request for the entire House.
It refers to an urgent matter which we will be discussing this afternoon.
This is the case of Aminatou Haidar.
We have an urgent matter on the agenda this afternoon.
I would ask my fellow Members to put their trust in me with regard to the following process. Some Members who have been closely involved with this case know – and I cannot
give any more details at this point, but I am one of those who knows – that we will have a solution for this case during the course of the day.
Prominent government representatives from the EU are working to achieve a positive solution.
Therefore, it would be sensible to remove this urgent matter from the agenda this afternoon, because any further debate would only hinder the work which is being done through diplomatic channels.
This is why I am asking the House to agree that in this exceptional case, we should remove this urgent matter from the agenda, because this will be of greater help in resolving the case than debating it would be.
That was my first request, Mr President.
The second request will follow immediately.
