Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, plant protection products were, and still are, essential agricultural resources.
Farmers require a minimum selection of plant protection products because it is a matter of protecting the indigenous cultural landscape, producing top-quality food and protecting resources.
Our debates about chemicals are too often conducted on a very irrational level.
We must think and act rationally if we are to achieve sensible results.
The effects of Parliament's original position would have been fatal: a blanket ban on plant protection products would result in lower agricultural yields and, ultimately, rising food prices.
Therefore, I am happy that an acceptable compromise was found in the trialogue negotiations.
It is welcome that we have retained the three-zone ruling even with considerable exemptions for Member States.
A courageous step to a consistent internal market solution would look different at this stage: Alongside the acceptable compromises achieved, we should not second guess a final definition of endocrinically effective substances but actually allow the Commission its four years to produce a scientifically-based definition.
Otherwise, we will overstretch the precautionary principle here.
I find it regrettable that we are not permitting any impact assessment of the agreement now reached.
