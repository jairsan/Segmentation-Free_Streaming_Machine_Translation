Madam President, Mr Å emeta, I would like to make a few comments on the tax agreement between Germany and Switzerland, as other speakers have done.
Instead of stopping tax evasion and blocking the loopholes for tax evaders, which would have been sensible, the result that has been produced here is a Swiss cheese full of large holes.
The proposed transition period of five months gives tax evaders plenty of time to transfer their money from Switzerland to other tax havens.
As foundations and trusts are not governed by the agreement, it is also possible to transform assets which have been stashed away in Switzerland into the assets of a foundation.
Forms for doing this can be obtained from Swiss banks.
Tax investigators in Germany have recently received information about a number of tax evaders who have hidden their assets away in Switzerland.
The agreement gives these people an amnesty and the tax investigators can no longer use the information that has been made available to them.
What sort of agreement is it that restricts the activities of tax investigators?
An advertising video produced by Swiss banks says about this agreement that customers will benefit even more in future from the values of Switzerland as a financial centre.
The agreement obviously not only lacks the necessary coordination at EU level, but also counteracts the efforts of the EU to bring more transparency into tax issues, to make the collection of tax in the Member States more efficient and, above all, to combat and to prevent tax fraud.
Therefore, this agreement is, in our view, not acceptable.
We are calling on the EU to oppose it, if there is any doubt.
