Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am astonished that we need to keep reminding people of what is meant by structural and cohesion policy.
Structural and cohesion policy is one of the key policy areas of the European Union and, by definition, it should serve the purpose of consolidating the economic and social cohesion of the Union, while at the same time promoting growth and employment, in underdeveloped regions in particular.
The necessity and success of structural and cohesion policy has been demonstrated especially clearly in these years of crisis.
The economic development situation in many regions would now be even bleaker had these funds not been made available.
Then comes the implementation of Structural Funds on the basis of operational programmes – as has already been pointed out – in which the promotional strategy of each region is described.
The European Union, Member States and regions work in partnership here and thus create real added value for Europe.
The success of structural and cohesion policy is based on the reliability of programming and funds which have either already been made available or are in the process of being made available.
I am, therefore, very surprised that, time and again, some Member States, and even the Commission – as we now see – attempt to make use of Structural Fund resources as a money box for all kinds of topical policy initiatives.
That is not consistent with the meaning and purpose of cohesion policy and, in addition, it causes concern amongst players in the regions who are already working to achieve objectives on the basis of long-term strategies and contracts.
It is true that tackling youth unemployment and commitment to economic growth are important goals.
However, they will only be achieved if the cooperative partnership between the regions, Member States and the Commission is maintained and if players in the regions continue to be involved.
After all, only they know what needs to be done in their regions.
Structural and cohesion policy is the unifying, cooperative, supportive bond of action between individual policy levels in the European Union.
It reflects the solidarity of Europe on the ground, in the regions, and it should not be recklessly abandoned in favour of political quick fixes.
