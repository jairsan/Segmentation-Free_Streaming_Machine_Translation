Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I see from the voting list that you, Mr President, intend to declare Amendment 2 inadmissible.
I would like to ask you to reconsider this.
It is correct that Article 229 of the treaty requires a session of the European Parliament to take place on the second Tuesday in March.
However, this does not conflict with the amendment tabled by my group.
My group â€™ s amendment aims to move the Strasbourg week from week 10 to week 11.
That does not prevent you from holding a plenary session on the second Tuesday in March.
We want the Strasbourg week to be week 11, but this does not mean that our amendment is inadmissible.
I would like to ask you to reconsider this.
