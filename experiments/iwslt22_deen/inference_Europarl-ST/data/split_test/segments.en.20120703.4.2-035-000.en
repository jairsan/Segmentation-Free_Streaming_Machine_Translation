Mr President, Prime Minister, as rapporteur for the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Budgetary Control, I completed two procedures under your Presidency: the Financial Regulation – providing a set of rules for the forthcoming multiannual financial framework (MFF) period – and the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) procedure.
This regulation had been stuck in a queue in the Council since November 2008, and building on the results of the Polish Presidency, you took this procedure to its conclusion.
I would therefore like to thank you for two really very committed financial officials who worked on these dossiers, and I would also like to thank Denmark ’ s ambassador, Mr Tranholm-Mikkelsen.
I will miss you; we will miss your efficient negotiation.
You have really served the financial interests of the European Union well.
Thank you very much.
