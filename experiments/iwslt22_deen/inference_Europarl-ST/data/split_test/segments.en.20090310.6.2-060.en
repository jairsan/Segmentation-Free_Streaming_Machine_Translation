Mr President, I want to keep this short.
I would like to offer my thanks for the constructive contributions that I have heard Members make to the debate today.
To conclude, I just have a couple more things to say. Firstly, I would like to offer my sincere thanks to the Commissioner for not categorically arguing against the concept of minimum requirements for the safety network.
This proposal is no work of the devil, nor is it a bureaucratic monster.
It is an instrument for solving problems and one that we should give a chance to.
For that reason I would like to take this opportunity just to call for your support for it once again.
The other thing I wanted to say I will direct at my British friends, and ‘ across all the parties ’.
My dear British friends, I do understand, Caroline, I can see your problem.
I can well understand that the energy security of a country will be put above compliance with an air pollution limit for a certain period of time.
I have a lot of sympathy for that.
I am also the last person who would fail to grant Her Majesty additional time when it comes to building new coal-fired power stations.
This is something that we can talk about.
The problem is that that is exactly what we have not done.
At no point in the last four months has this conversation taken place.
I want to urge you, at this point – looking forward to second reading now – to be open-minded once again and to say ‘ let us talk about a compromise now ’ and, to that end, to give up the resistance – which, in my view, is completely irrational – and the fundamental opposition to the minimum standards, which is unjustifiable from the point
resistance – which, in my view, is completely irrational – and the fundamental opposition to the minimum standards, which is unjustifiable from the point of view of either competition policy or environmental policy.
I think that a compromise can be reached on this, something I also hope to see at the end of the second reading.
Incidentally, I am not of the view that we should not seek compromises at first reading.
This legislation is too complex for that.
I do not wish to end this parliamentary term as rapporteur and hand on legislation to the next Parliament where the text of the directive that is debated is inconsistent, illogical and contradictory.
I therefore ask for your support for the compromises when we vote in an hour ’ s time.
