Mr President, during the debate on the European Council here this morning there was an incident that I do not wish to go into again, because I was the target of an insult.
However, I will say this: there are levels at which I cannot be insulted and where I do not see it as an insult either, because in order to insult me, someone must have a certain degree of sincerity.
However, I would like to express my sincere thanks for the numerous signs of solidarity that I have since received in this House.
I would very much like to thank my fellow Members from all groups.
That is a sign of the common, democratic and pro-European conviction that the overwhelming majority of this House shares.
I would like to thank you very sincerely for this.
