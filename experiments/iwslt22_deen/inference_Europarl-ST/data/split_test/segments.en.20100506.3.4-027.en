Mr President, the previous speakers have rightly highlighted the importance of the European Investment Bank (EIB).
Mrs Kadenbach, for example, has referred to its essential contribution to social convergence.
I would like to put that in a political context.
We are very concerned to see that parties of the extreme right are gaining popularity in more and more countries.
This is because social convergence in the European Union is not working in the way in which we would all have liked.
These radical right-wingers are very often wolves in sheep ’ s clothing, which allows them to conceal their massive and cynical contempt for humanity.
My final example, Mr President – and I am aware of your political leanings – concerns what Mr Mölzer has just done. He has made a nice little speech, but in the meantime he has called one of his political opponents – in other words, me – a psychopath.
That is the language of Hitler ’ s fascism. This is the way in which these people work, by branding their political opponents as monsters.
I would like to ask you to take the necessary measures and I would also like to ask the staff of the EIB to continue with their work, in particular in the area of transparency. They should make what they do even more transparent, because this approach will help to combat the new rise of fascism.
