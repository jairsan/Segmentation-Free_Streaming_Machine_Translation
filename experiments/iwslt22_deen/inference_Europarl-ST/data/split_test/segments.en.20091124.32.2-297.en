Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left will not be giving the resolution its backing.
The Stockholm Programme completely fails to address the real challenges of the present day.
Its main error is that a Europe of rights is being created to which EU citizens will be granted access but others who live in Europe will not.
These other people will not be entitled to the same human and civil rights.
The EU wants to accede to the European Convention on Human Rights – something that we welcome – yet, at the same time, migrants are to be separated out according to the ‘ legal or illegal ’ principle.
Frontex is therefore being tooled up to wage war on so-called illegal migration, completely obscuring the idea of an unprejudiced immigration policy from view.
This is where Stockholm fails.
Another problem is the complete imbalance between freedom and security.
It is true that there is no freedom without security, but it is also the case that there is no security without freedom. Freedom is not something to be negotiated, it is a universal right for every human being.
Stockholm, in contrast, symbolises the EU ’ s manic lust for security, in which giant supranational databases are to be created without adequate opportunities for control, which will then mix intelligence service and police data on a pan-European basis.
This will mean the shredding of people ’ s right to self-determination in relation to their data and that the vision of a see-through human being will actually be the reality.
Allow me, as an MEP from eastern Germany, to conclude by observing that I find it insufferable, 20 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, that Europe is coming more and more to resemble a fortress.
