Mr President, Mr Barroso, I have already made it clear in the first round of speeches what I would like the focus of our attention to be.
My group expects the Commission to fulfil its responsibilities in the relevant bodies such as the troika, in order to make it entirely clear that the Commission as a European institution wants to
Commission as a European institution wants to ensure that people are no longer pushed into poverty, that working hours are not increased and that environmental and social standards are not ignored.
That is your job.
If we succeed in making that clear, then we will be sending out a signal to the people who in recent days have gone out onto the streets in their thousands and hundreds of thousands to protest. Our group is in solidarity with these people, whether they are in Thessaloniki or Barcelona.
I heard this morning on the news that cancer patients are protesting in Greece.
How bad has the situation become when people who are in the midst of a serious social and personal crisis are not receiving any more help and support, because the health system has collapsed?
We finally need to take action in this area.
Many people in positions of responsibility believe that people in Greece and in other states have been living beyond their means.
They must now be punished for this and have sanctions imposed on them.
This is not an appropriate way of strengthening the European community, which is based on solidarity.
I am not implying that you are one of these people, Mr Barroso, but this is a theme which is being constantly repeated in the media in many countries and, unfortunately, also in mine.
