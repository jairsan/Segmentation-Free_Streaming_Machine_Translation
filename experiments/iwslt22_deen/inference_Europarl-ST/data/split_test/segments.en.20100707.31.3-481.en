Madam President, Baroness Ashton, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have been shocked by recent events in Kyrgyzstan – the violent outbreaks, human slaughter, the burning
shocked by recent events in Kyrgyzstan – the violent outbreaks, human slaughter, the burning of houses and the flood of thousands of refugees leaving their homes in an effort to escape the violence – and am filled with sympathy for the victims.
At the same time, these events in Kyrgyzstan throw light on the situation in Central Asia, which should not leave us unconcerned here in the European Parliament.
On the contrary, we should turn all our attention to the countries of this region.
We should consider not just those countries that are rich in mineral resources, making them of particular economic interest to us in Europe, but, in line with the strategy for Central Asia adopted in 2007, we should deal with all countries equally.
I believe that this is our duty.
The states of Central Asia, which managed to throw off Tsarist and then Soviet rule less than 20 years ago, have a difficult legacy.
The borders drawn up arbitrarily by Stalin with no concern for the homelands of the peoples living in the region clearly make coexistence difficult both within the borders of these countries and beyond.
Poverty, corruption, disregard for human rights and minority rights, authoritarian regimes, economic conditions in countries like Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan, which force hundreds of thousands to emigrate in search of
, and conflict resolution through the use of violent force, all mean that there is a question mark over how the countries in this region are to develop in the future.
The European Union cannot stand idly by while this happens.
If we want to ensure that these states do not end up adopting fundamentalist structures and that the people there are not permanent victims of dictatorial regimes, then our complete commitment is required.
In addition to answering the urgent need for material help, we need contact with these countries, offering active support for the democratic forces developing there.
Let us allow President Roza Otunbayeva the chance to bring peace to Kyrgyzstan and to begin the establishment of stable political conditions. The resolution debated today and voted on tomorrow
resolution debated today and voted on tomorrow should be followed by actions, so that the people in Kyrgyzstan and the other Central Asian states do not feel that we are leaving them alone to find their future path or abandoning them to undemocratic forces.
These countries have high expectations of us Europeans and we should not disappoint them.
