Madam President, Commissioner, Mr LÃ³pez Garrido, with the analysis of Passenger Name Record (PNR) data, as with SWIFT, an attempt is being made to reconcile the fight against global terrorism and
reconcile the fight against global terrorism and serious crime with the fundamental rights of all to the protection of privacy and information self-determination.
We must also be aware, however, that in this age of mobility, there cannot be adequate security in Europe and worldwide without effective and rapid data exchange.
In the digital age, we also have to ensure special protection as regards information self-determination and privacy.
I therefore also consider it essential to make a more exact distinction between data needed to fight crime and sensitive private data.
For me, there is no doubt that we must firmly integrate controls, the right of appeal, access rights, claims for damages, as well as the length of the retention period, in the agreement.
Using the push method, it should be checked whether there can or need to be exceptions in urgent cases.
As regards the use of PNR data, we should also include serious crime.
To me, that includes offences like child pornography, people trafficking, murder, rape and also drug trafficking.
In my opinion, this would also contribute to protecting the personal rights of those affected.
I think it is good that we are taking a decision on the agreement on PNR data, in order to develop a basic model for all future agreements of this sort
develop a basic model for all future agreements of this sort and to recommend a negotiating framework to the Commission, so that it takes into account our own ideas on data protection.
Perhaps in future, there will also be room to consider combating terrorism and crime together with our transatlantic partners in a joint institution.
That would certainly also be a step towards confronting globalised crime on a global scale.
