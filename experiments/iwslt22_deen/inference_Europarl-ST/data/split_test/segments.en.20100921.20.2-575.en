Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I note that the Council does not wish to debate the multiannual financial framework.
May I tell the Council that the European Parliament would very much like to debate it, and that the Council cannot act as if it is in a kindergarten by telling us that it will not answer our questions or comment on our proposals.
Secondly, in this connection, I must ask the Council whether it wants to have Lisbon or not.
Lisbon is not a mere technical adjustment; it imposes more competences and means there are more responsibilities to discharge – and that includes answering related financial questions.
Moreover, the Council has taken decisions that result in new financial expenditure.
That has been mentioned by many of my fellow Members.
If the Council wishes to do this, and if it does not want more money to be spent, then it must also state quite specifically where and how it wishes savings to be made, where exactly these funds are to be shifted from – and not simply propose general percentages to be redeployed
propose general percentages to be redeployed while leaving Parliament and the Commission with the unpleasant task of deciding where the money is to be taken from, especially since our opportunities for redeployment and budgetary revision are extremely limited.
The additional responsibilities that you have imposed on us are so challenging that they do not involve small incidental amounts – I will merely mention the area of the financial solidarity of our Member States and their corresponding financial difficulties.
If the programme is to be implemented, then we are not taking about small sums that can be redeployed without further consideration.
The same applies to ITER, the same applies to matters of internal security, the same applies to significant matters relating to research, the same also applies to questions concerning Parliament ’ s priority areas such as youth training and research.
We have to deal not only with shortcomings in implementation, but also with a lack of transparency when it comes to the disbursement of funds.
We need to debate and work through all these matters quite specifically; the Council cannot simply keep silent on them.
