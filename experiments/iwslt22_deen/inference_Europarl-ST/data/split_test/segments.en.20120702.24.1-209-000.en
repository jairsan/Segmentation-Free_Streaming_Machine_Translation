Madam President, many thousands of people could still have been alive today, or could have avoided permanent disabilities, had they received professional medical aid quickly enough after their accidents, specifically, within the first, or ‘ golden ’ hour.
We would be a large step closer to ‘ vision zero ’.
The eCall system that we are discussing today cannot prevent any accidents, nor does it provide any release from the obligation to provide first aid.
It simply serves to automatically notify an emergency call control centre in the event of a serious accident.
The control centre must make voice contact with the vehicle involved in an accident in order to avoid misuse and overloading with trivial incidents.
Only when the emergency call is confirmed or if no one answers any more will emergency medics be sent out to the accident site, armed with little, but life-critical, information.
The responsibility for the functioning of this chain of emergency service provision lies with the Member States on the basis of subsidiarity.
As long as the sensors built into the vehicle do not detect an accident, the eCall system is on standby, in other words, it does not send any signals or data of any kind and is not locatable.
It is therefore far from being a mobile phone from the point of view of data protection.
Only if the system is woken up by the automatic sensors or conscious manual activation does it become active.
It then sends an agreed, minimum set of data from the information to an emergency services control centre.
Uniform Europe-wide standards and specifications will ensure that these data are recognised, assessed and handled as emergency calls on receipt.
The Member States therefore need to develop and equip their chain of emergency service provision accordingly.
We want this eCall emergency calling system to be based on the common EU emergency number (112), to be free for the user, to work everywhere in the EU and to be compatible with emergency call systems in neighbouring third countries.
It should be based on an interoperable, technology-neutral, open system architecture.
At a later date, this could also enable other intelligent public road-related services to be offered, such as real time traffic information or the availability of parking spaces.
In recognition of the outstanding efforts of the motor industry to provide private emergency call systems, it is intended that these will retain their right to exist in parallel to the public, 112-based eCall system.
Users can also opt for such a system based on comprehensive information.
This may be accompanied by the potentially also paid-for use of the data by workshops, insurance companies, breakdown services or other service providers.
Where 80% of car drivers want to see this kind of system, which is also welcomed and requested by associations and organisations for the disabled, we must not either delay it or stand in its way. I anticipate approval by the House with a large majority tomorrow.
