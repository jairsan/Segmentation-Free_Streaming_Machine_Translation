Madam President, just as I have done for many years, I am today working for road safety, for an improvement in working conditions for professional drivers, and for an improvement in their professional image.
It is obvious that what we are debating today is not the provisions on driving hours and rest times, which impact on road safety and are applicable to all professional drivers, be they employed or self-employed; rather, it is about the regulation of working hours.
It is primarily a regulation for the protection of employees – in other words, it is solely for the social protection of drivers and in no way serves road safety.
There is no need to protect the self-employed from themselves.
How would we check the hours worked by self-employed HGV and bus drivers without a huge amount of bureaucracy, and on what basis would we be checking this anyway?
Restricting the permissible working hours of self-employed professional drivers in this way – and perhaps, in future, also those of self-employed tradesmen, architects or Members of Parliament – would send out the wrong signal.
Instead, the Member States should be working to combat the problem of ostensible self-employment among drivers.
I am in favour of the proposal put by the European Commission and Mrs Bauer.
