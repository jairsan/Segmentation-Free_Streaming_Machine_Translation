Madam President, I would like to congratulate everyone involved, but in particular, Mr Cancian, for all his efforts during the tough and long-winded process of reaching a compromise on this difficult dossier.
Some of the successes have already been mentioned, but there were also disappointments, in particular, with regard to the scope and other small points which have been referred to.
By coming to this compromise on bus and coach transport, we have established passengers ’ rights on all types of transport.
The next step which we need to take is to create a common, coherent and efficient framework programme for all passengers ’ rights.
It is particularly important for the credibility of the EU among the citizens of Europe that we put in place fair and clearly defined rights.
In order to be credible, we must ensure that the rights across all the different means of transport are coherent.
The criteria relating to air passengers ’ rights must not be fundamentally different from those of rail passengers, for example.
Therefore, it is particularly important that we do not base our framework programme on the lowest, weakest standards. Instead, we must set ourselves ambitious goals on behalf of the citizens of Europe.
