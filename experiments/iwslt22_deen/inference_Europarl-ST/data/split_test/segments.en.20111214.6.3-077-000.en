Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the new surveillance mechanism for economic imbalances has been in force since yesterday.
The detailed regulations are also now available.
What developments does the Commission now see as dangerous and what economic problems do you want to see rectified?
Increases in unit labour costs in the euro area countries in excess of 3% per year are considered by the Commission to be a problem.
A limit value for falling wages is not provided for, however.
I would say to the Commission that ‘ cheap ’ is not the same thing as ‘ good ’.
It is not enough to condition the Member States to achieve prosperity at the expense of their trading partners.
Without investment in education, health and energy efficiency, we can exploit our workers to the bone, but that will not enable us to write an economic success story.
I would like to mention one more example from the scoreboard: the loss of export market share should be examined and penalties imposed.
That is nonsense.
In the face of increasing world trade, Europe ’ s share will, statistically speaking, inevitably shrink.
Consequently, this indicator will penalise those countries that are already closely involved in world trade.
We therefore believe that the Commission should withdraw this scoreboard and subject it to a general overhaul.
