Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, with regard to such an important and far-reaching subject as the White Paper on the future of transport, the risk is always great that we will end up with something that looks like a Christmas tree with everyone attempting to get two or three of their favourite subjects included.
If we look at the result, which we will vote on tomorrow, then we can, without a doubt, congratulate our rapporteur, Mr Grosch.
From several hundred amendments, he succeeded in producing a sound, coherent and comprehensible result that places the main focus as regards transport of the future on safety, environmental protection, energy and technology.
I expressly welcome the fact that such important issues as the social, health and labour law-related conditions of the employees have been suitably mentioned here.
This is particularly important in view of the threat of a shortage of workers in the transport sector, which is something we must actively do something about if we want to prevent bottlenecks for well-trained workers in the future.
There is a further opening up of cabotage in road transport only on condition that social dumping and unfair conditions are prevented.
I also welcome the fact that improving road safety is considered an important aspect here.
The safety of our roads is a subject that we need to concern ourselves with more in the future, too.
There are other aspects that I view in a more critical light.
Thus, I would have liked there to have been a statement regarding modal shift in order to shift more traffic from the roads to the railways and waterways.
For this reason, I think the discussion regarding gigaliners is not the best solution for increased sustainability.
Equally worthy of criticism is the further liberalisation of the railway sector, and we ought to wait and give the matter further consideration before opening up national passenger transport.
We still have to carry out some technical harmonisation in this area and to establish fair competition conditions.
However, as I said, I hope that this report, which expresses the expectations of Parliament, will not remain a pious wish-list, but that we will achieve our goal by 2020 and our proposals will have been put into practice.
