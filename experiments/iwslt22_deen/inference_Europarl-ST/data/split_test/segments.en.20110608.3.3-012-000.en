Mr Hartong, of course I recognise this right.
I only hope that you also recognise that the position of the Dutch Government cannot simply be handed down ex cathedra, but that it should be debated in a multinational democracy.
I have absolute respect for Mr Rutte, who is in favour of a 2.7% increase in the EU budget.
I have taken note of this and am pleased that you have listened attentively because the positions of all governments are debated openly in this Parliament.
To this extent, I failed to understand the meaning of your question, but what I believe I can glean from it is that you also support democracy.
I suppose that this represents some sort of progress.
