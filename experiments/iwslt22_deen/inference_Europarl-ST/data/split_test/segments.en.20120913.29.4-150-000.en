Mr President, I must admit, I have made a mistake.
I wish to give an explanation of vote not in respect of this report, but in respect of the Moreira report on the agreement concerning immediate autonomous trade preferences for Pakistan.
Can I please ask you to give me the floor again at the appropriate time?
