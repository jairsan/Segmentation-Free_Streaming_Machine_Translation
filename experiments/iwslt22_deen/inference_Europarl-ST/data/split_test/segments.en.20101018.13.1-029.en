Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we have undoubtedly made progress in recent years on the issue of equality between men and women, yet there are still many women who are forced into low-skilled jobs.
That applies not just to activities that are traditionally carried out within the family.
The deregulation that has taken place in recent years has frequently resulted in employment that provides mandatory social insurance being replaced by employment conditions that are atypical, precarious and uncertain.
Women, in particular, have been affected by this.
The trend in employment in Europe between 2000 and 2010 is for 60% to be made up of new, precarious and atypical types of employment, primarily – two thirds – taken up by women.
Women are frequently debarred from democratic participation in organisations by virtue of being employed on a part-time basis and on precarious conditions.
Yet women are now much more committed and better trained than in any previous generation.
Nonetheless, on average, they earn 25% less than men.
The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has looked into this matter intensively and has developed good proposals on the issue of female employment: inclusion in social security systems regardless of job status
social security systems regardless of job status; the establishment of childcare facilities; aligning retirement pensions and social systems with independent living; and organising work according to ‘ good work ’ principles.
All this is essentially contained in the report on precarious women workers.
The Employment Committee is satisfied with the results of this work and urges the House to vote in favour of the report presented.
