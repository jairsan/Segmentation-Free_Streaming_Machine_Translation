Mr President ‘ consider before you form an opinion ’ – that is what the Polish aphorist, Stanisław Jerzy Lec, demands, and it would also do us good to heed this recommendation sometimes here in Parliament.
a few weeks after the resolution on a strategy for Central Asia was adopted here in this House, which sought to censure the states of Central Asia, we are now responding to events in connection with strikes in Zhanaozen
in connection with strikes in Zhanaozen in Kazakhstan without waiting for the outcome of the ongoing investigations that are being carried out with international involvement.
As regrettable as the deaths are and as much as those who were injured and imprisoned during the course of these events have the right to a review of what happened, the reasons behind these events remain unclear.
Thus, Vladimir Kozlov, leader of the unregistered opposition party, Alga, stated that ‘ it was a different group of people; the unrest was by no means in the interests of those who were striking, as it merely provided a reason for violence to be used against them ’.
The Central Asia expert, Arkady Dubnov, also said: ‘ It cannot be ruled out that elements of the Kazakh opposition who live abroad will also get involved.
On the other hand, maintaining the tensions could be very much in the interest of someone in the Kazakh capital, Astana.
After all, Kazakhstan ’ s power elite are already fighting for the chance to become President Nursultan Nazarbayev ’ s successor ’.
We had the opportunity here in Parliament to speak with the Kazakh opposition in the presence of the Kazakh ambassador.
The UN Special Representative stated today that he is impressed by the attention that the Kazakh Government is giving to the events in Zhanaozen and that it is necessary to uncover the true facts behind the unrest.
We ought to take the Kazakh authorities at their word and measure them by their actions, but we should not make premature, reflex judgments.
