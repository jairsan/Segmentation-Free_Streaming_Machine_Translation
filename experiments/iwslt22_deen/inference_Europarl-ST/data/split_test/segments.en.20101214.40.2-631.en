Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I would like to thank those who have worked on this report and, in particular, Mr Bendtsen.
I would like to mention two aspects and perhaps give you pause for thought.
We are all agreed that energy efficiency, using energy economically, is the most simple and most sensible solution.
The question is: how do we achieve this goal?
I would also like to ask the question: what have we actually achieved here in Parliament by keep going back to the people with new and higher percentages?
Have we really achieved more and had more of an effect?
Why and in which areas have we been using energy more efficiently?
I am told that industry, which consumes a lot of energy, is using energy more efficiency because it saves money by doing so and because it is beneficial for it.
I am also told that when people know that a particular appliance consumes more or less energy, in other words, if they can see that and can see an advantage to themselves, they will decide in favour of energy efficiency.
Perhaps working with percentages is completely the wrong way to go about it and we should instead take an incentives approach.
My second question is: the Commissioner made some very eloquent and clear comments about how complicated it is just to explain what energy efficiency is. What is it in fact?
How differently is it implemented in the Member States?
My fellow Member has just pointed out that the Member States also have very different situations in terms of their economies and geography â€“ completely different.
Is it the right solution to work with a single binding figure, or should we not think of something else?
I think that, in terms of energy policy, we need, to a certain extent, to move away from the debate of the past, which sought to achieve something with simple figures, binding targets and miracle solutions, because we have clearly not achieved enough.
Perhaps, for once, we should try the alternative route of differentiated, varied solutions, which takes account of the different situations, but then also achieves results.
What matters is the effect we achieve rather than our particular circumstances.
