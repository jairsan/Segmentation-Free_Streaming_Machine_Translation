Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Afghanistan has had a difficult history.
I believe that families in particular stick together very strongly in that country and that the woman of the family has an important role.
It is therefore very important above all to promote economic development and in particular support for small and medium-sized enterprises.
Of course, a modern infrastructure is also needed to enable the country to develop better.
I believe that it is precisely infrastructure projects that could help to create a greater understanding for one another in this country and that also through the agency of information and communications technology a different world view could slowly develop there, whilst fully retaining the country â€™ s identity.
