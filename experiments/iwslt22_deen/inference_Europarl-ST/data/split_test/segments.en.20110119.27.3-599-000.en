Mr President, thank you very much for allowing me to speak again briefly.
I have a request for you, Mr FÃ¼le.
I would like to start by saying that incorrect assumptions lead to incorrect cost estimates.
At the moment, the number of asylum seekers is not falling, but rising significantly.
This is a result of visa facilitation, for example, for Serbia and Macedonia.
We are currently also seeing a massive increase in abuses of the asylum system as part of attempts to enter countries in the European Union.
If you start with incorrect assumptions, in other words, that disputing the first instance in detail will save costs in subsequent instances, it will automatically seem as if all Member States have poor first-instance procedures.
However, that is not the case.
If overall standards are raised, the consequence will be cost increases.
Improving the standard of quality for everyone and making the procedures more complex will, in reality, result in increased costs. I am more than happy to discuss this point.
Therefore, I would like to ask you specifically to take the concerns of the countries seriously, because some of the practical reports from the countries have already been completed and will be distributed.
