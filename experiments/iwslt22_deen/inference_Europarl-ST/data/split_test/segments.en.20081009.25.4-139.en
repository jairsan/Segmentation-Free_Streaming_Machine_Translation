Mr President, I voted in favour of the resolution as it represents an unequivocal call to the Belarusian Government to respect human rights at last.
It is disappointing that hopes of democratic development for the Belarusian people who have to live under Europe â€™ s last dictatorship were not fulfilled by the parliamentary elections which took place in September and which were dubious, if not to say falsified.
The same applies to the strategic repression of the opposition and civil society.
We have also called on the Council and the Commission today to take further steps towards facilitating and intensifying people-to-people contacts and democratising the country and to consider the possibilities for lowering the cost of
the cost of visas for Belarusian citizens entering the Schengen territory, which is the only way to prevent Belarus and its citizens from becoming increasingly isolated.
