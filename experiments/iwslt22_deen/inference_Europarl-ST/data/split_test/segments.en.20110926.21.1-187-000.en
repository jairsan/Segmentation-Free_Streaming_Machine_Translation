Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, yes indeed, we should concentrate on urgent and important matters in connection with road safety.
I am firmly convinced of that, and in my opinion that means first and foremost the two greatest reducers of attentiveness while driving, namely alcohol and excessive speed.
The European Union must also say something in this regard and not merely propose technical measures, which, although good in my opinion, are a long way from being adequate.
In towns and cities in particular, lack of attentiveness – the problem of inattentive drivers – is particularly dramatic.
Therefore, the speed must be lowered here.
I was very pleasantly surprised to see that there was a broad majority in favour of the recommendation for a 30 km / h speed limit.
Particular consideration must be given – this is also contained in the report, and I consider it to be important and positive – to finally focusing our attention on vulnerable road users, and I hope that these measures will at last, once and for all, actually be implemented.
