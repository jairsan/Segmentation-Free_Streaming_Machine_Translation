Mr President, Mrs Georgieva, ladies and gentlemen, only a few days ago, we saw the shocking images on the television of huge areas of Poland and other Central European countries under the flood waters.
People have died in these floods and our sympathy goes out to their relatives and friends. Villages, towns, agricultural land and infrastructure have all been destroyed.
The television pictures have already been replaced by other images, but the extensive damage now has to be slowly and laboriously repaired.
These countries should have the solidarity of the other countries in the European Union behind them during the work on repairing damage on this scale.
Following the flood disaster of 1997, Poland and other Central European countries have once again been hit by devastating floods.
We cannot control the weather and it is in the nature of rivers to flood at certain times.
However, the questions that we have to ask are whether, given that natural disasters can happen at any time, the right measures have been taken to prevent the damage caused by natural phenomena of this kind and whether, for example, sufficient attention has been paid to issues of sustainable disaster prevention
have been taken to prevent the damage caused by natural phenomena of this kind and whether, for example, sufficient attention has been paid to issues of sustainable disaster prevention during the landscape planning process.
If we are to provide aid, we must ensure firstly that it goes to those directly affected by the natural disaster in order to safeguard their livelihoods.
Then it is a question of the Member States working together, because natural disasters do not stop at national borders, with coordination on a European level to do more to prevent the damage caused by disasters of this kind.
The flood protection system on the River Oder, which has been built jointly by the Polish and German authorities, is a clear indication that joint prevention measures can provide real protection.
However, we have still not done enough.
We do not need a European disaster prevention programme.
The government of each country should take primary responsibility for protecting that country against disasters, including drawing up disaster plans.
However, in the case of a disaster and when damage has been caused, the aid provided can effectively be coordinated at a European level and the voluntary organisations which provide aid should have their expenses reimbursed quickly and without red tape.
Therefore, I support Mrs Georgieva â€™ s plans, which will allow us to turn these aims into reality quickly.
