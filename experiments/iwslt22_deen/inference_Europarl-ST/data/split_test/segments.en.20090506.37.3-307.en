Madam President, the Group of the European People ’ s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats calls on the Government and the Communist Party of China to conduct the upcoming human rights dialogue in a constructive manner.
This would significantly ease relations between the EU and China.
We have a genuine interest in improving bilateral relations.
However, this dialogue must be conducted honestly.
We will therefore have to uphold our legitimate demands on China.
In our view, the civil rights campaigner, Hu Jia, must be released immediately.
Talks with the Dalai Lama, the religious leader of the Tibetans, must be resumed.
The Chinese region of Tibet must be opened up to journalists and UN human rights experts.
In my opinion, the People ’ s Republic of China demonstrated in the run-up to the Olympic Games that it could, for example, grant more press freedom while preserving the stability of the country.
Now, it should have the courage to initiate reforms relating to re ­ education camps, the rights of defendants, the death penalty, religious freedom and freedom of assembly.
It should genuinely tackle these human rights and hold talks with us.
