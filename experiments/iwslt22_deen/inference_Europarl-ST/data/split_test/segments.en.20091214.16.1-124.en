Mr President, we need a revolution in democracy.
I recall very clearly that the debates that we are hearing today started ten years ago in this House.
I would appeal to you, Commissioner, to take particular account of what Mr DÃ©sir has said, but also of what the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance and some of the Members on the left have said.
Do you not see that, with the approach with which the European Union has entered the negotiations, we cannot, as honest brokers, overcome the imbalance in relation to what we are currently seeing in Copenhagen, and that in reality, we need a new approach?
In much of what they are doing today, the developing countries are no longer developing countries.
They are emerging economies, industrialised countries and very self-aware.
If we, in Europe, do not succeed in daring to start anew with fair requirements, then we will end up exactly where we do not want to be, namely with protectionism and with a repeat of 1933 and subsequent years in Europe.
