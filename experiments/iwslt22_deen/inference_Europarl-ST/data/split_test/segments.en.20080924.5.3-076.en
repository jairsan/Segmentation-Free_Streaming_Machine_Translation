Mr President, India and Europe need more and better contacts with each other at all levels, but particularly between ordinary people: business people

In international aviation, we need good security regulations that are genuinely useful and effective and not simply token gestures.
One sensible and genuinely necessary measure would therefore be to abolish the senseless rules that prevent passengers from taking liquids on board at last, and to come up with a more sensible solution.
