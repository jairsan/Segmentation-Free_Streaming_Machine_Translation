, I believe that we must attempt, in collaboration with the European Asylum Support Office and the Greek authorities, to identify which of the people who have come to Greece could possibly
could possibly be transferred to other countries within the European Union, firstly, because they can definitely never return to their home country and, secondly, because they may have potential and qualifications which are appropriate and useful.
However, this is essentially also about helping the Greeks to register and identify these people more quickly, so that help can be provided sooner and so that those people who do
those people who do not have qualifications or the entitlement to live in Greece or the European Union can be returned to their home countries, because they do have the opportunity of remaining there.
