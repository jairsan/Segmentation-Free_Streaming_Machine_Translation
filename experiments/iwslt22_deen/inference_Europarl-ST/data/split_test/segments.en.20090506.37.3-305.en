Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, should like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Obiols i Germà, on his very good report.
Things look very bad for respect for human rights in many countries worldwide.
This is also of relevance for Europe – when we think of Belarus for instance.
The European Union must therefore redouble its efforts by implementing its human rights policy in all areas and by setting clear standards.
It is our understanding that human rights are indivisible.
This can be taken into consideration for example during the negotiations for a new agreement with Russia through a binding human rights clause, which will influence all areas of the negotiations.
I should also like to suggest once again that the Subcommittee on Human Rights be made a standing committee.
