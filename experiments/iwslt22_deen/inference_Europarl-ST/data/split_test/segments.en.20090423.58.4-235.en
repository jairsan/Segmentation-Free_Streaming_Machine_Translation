Mr President, for the first time since becoming a Member of this House, I voted in the vote on discharge against discharge of the Commission and I should like to
I should like to explain my reasons: my basic concern is the manner in which the European Commission handled the accession of the two new countries, namely Romania and Bulgaria.
We have a great many problems to contend with in Romania and Bulgaria, with widespread corruption, with a lot of money, a lot of European money that has gone missing.
The European Commission did not start freezing this money until 2008.
We lost a great deal of money in 2007 and now have to contend with control systems which are barely even there or control systems which only function intermittently.
In Romania we have extensive corruption and problems with the judiciary to contend with.
All this has to be blamed on the pre-accession process.
I want to give a sign, to say to the European Commission that, in future, it must deal with accessions differently and to also say to it that, had it been observed in other countries in the past, it could be progressing much more successfully now had it wanted to.
I should like to call on the Commission to help both countries put financial control systems in place that are worthy to be called as much and to help rectify the systemic weaknesses in these two countries.
Otherwise we shall have a permanent problem here, a permanent pain in the neck for the whole of Europe.
