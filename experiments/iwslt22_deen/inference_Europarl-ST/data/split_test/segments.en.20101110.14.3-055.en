Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the transatlantic dialogue, there are many things that unite us – I am talking about basic values, the fundamental rights of freedom and democracy – but there are also some things that divide us, namely, how these rights are applied and put in concrete terms when it comes to transatlantic relations.
In particular, this contradiction repeatedly comes very clearly to the fore in respect of security issues.
Data protection is a source of constant misunderstanding; we have long known that.
Consequently, the framework agreement – if we succeed in bringing about a very good one – will be a great step forward.
We need to find a solution here that also enables citizens on both sides of the Atlantic to assert their rights in respect of the other partner.
A second important area in which our principles are similar but our approaches diverge considerably is the area of climate change.
I would therefore very much like to see this on the agenda and being clearly discussed.
We cannot allow the European Union to use the transatlantic dialogue to weaken its own promises and commitments.
