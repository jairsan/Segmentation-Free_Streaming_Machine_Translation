Mr President, what would we have advised our fellow parliamentarians in 1931 or 1938, when we were in the Depression, when the financial markets had already annulled the democracies â€“ and when we were heading for war?
Two things would be necessary, two emergency measures: we need something like a transitional arrangement.
Do what you have to do and do it quickly. Do not allow yourselves to be slowed down. Regulate every product, every institution and every player, as Chancellor Merkel
Chancellor Merkel has said. However, a transitional arrangement implementing the fiscal emergency programme cannot, on its own, have a future without an emergency programme for democracy.
In this case, what this means is that we clearly do need a new European community, we clearly do need different treaties and we clearly do need an opus that works but that is legitimate and acquires legitimacy through referendums.
We would have to begin the campaign for this now that the situation has become so dramatic that there must be a serious rethink before the Right, before the national splitters, again get the upper hand in relation to something that had actually already been established.
