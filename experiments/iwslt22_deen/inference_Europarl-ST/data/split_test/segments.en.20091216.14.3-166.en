Madam President, today, after eight years, we all essentially know that the previous Afghanistan strategy based on military force has failed.
The imbalance between military operations, on the one hand, and the insufficient resources for civil purposes, on the other, is directly preventing any improvement in the living conditions in Afghanistan.
Thus, the most important message from the Confederal Group of the European United Left â€“ Nordic Green Left is that we need a radical change of strategy.
We need a radical change of strategy away from the military and, above all, towards a more people-centred strategy.
Forty percent of Afghans are unemployed and more than half of them live in utter poverty without any health care or adequate education.
The focus must be placed on the social issue, and that is what I expect from the Council, the Commission and all the actors involved here.
This, of course, includes increasing good governance, strengthening agriculture and integrating former Taliban fighters.
However, I say this to you most sincerely: if we only go half way to doing this and once again rely on military force, we will squander our chances.
Time is running out!
