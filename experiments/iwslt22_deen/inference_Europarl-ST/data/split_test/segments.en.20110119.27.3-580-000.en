Mr President, it is important that the EU comes to grips with the problems of migration and the right of asylum.
The Commission has submitted proposals in this area.
However, there is currently no accurate analysis of the implementation of existing legal provisions.
There are also hardly any detailed calculations and analyses concerning the new proposals.
The Group of the European People ’ s Party (Christian Democrats) wholeheartedly supports the right of asylum and the right to protection for people who need it.
However, when we look at the actual situation, it is unfortunately clear that people are applying for asylum for very different reasons or even systematically abusing the system.
The right of asylum and subsidiary protection is not a tool for general migration into the 27 Member States.
We must ensure that the organised people traffickers do not have the opportunity to make billions of euro in profit out of people ’ s fates as a result of our right of asylum.
Asylum procedures must be fit for purpose and they must be implemented with great care.
Victims of persecution must be guaranteed a refuge in the EU.
This is why the Commission ’ s obligations in this respect are laid down in the new drafts.
I think many of them are appropriate, including interpreters, proper healthcare and taking into consideration special protection needs.
However, I would also like to mention the points which I believe are problematic.
The authorities in the Member States are being given far too few opportunities to prevent abuse.
The option of the accelerated procedure and the border procedure should be restricted by applying charges.
If an applicant commits a serious breach of his duty of cooperation, there are very few possibilities of imposing sanctions. On the contrary, if an asylum seeker disappears, the Member State cannot bring the procedure to a negative conclusion.
If he reappears, he is offered an extended range of procedural options. Even if an application is obviously without any foundation, the use of the accelerated procedure will only be possible after the second subsequent application.
This will lead to significant cost increases.
The current Commission draft states that free legal advice will be available from a lawyer, which will also result in the Member States ’ costs rising considerably.
I would simply like the Commission to reconsider the practical consequences of its proposals, the financial impact and the problems for the authorities in the Member States.
We want to see a system with high standards, but it must be workable and should not present already overburdened Member States with completely impossible tasks.
