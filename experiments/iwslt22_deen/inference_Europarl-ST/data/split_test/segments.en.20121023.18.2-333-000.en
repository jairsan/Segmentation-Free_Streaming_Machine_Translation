Mr President, dual-use items often look harmless, but in the hands of authoritarian regimes they can be as lethal as machine guns or tanks.
We undermine our foreign policy goals if we send surveillance technologies to authoritarian regimes which can then use them to monitor and suppress democracy movements.
It was European mobile phone software produced by Nokia Siemens Networks which played into the hands of the Iranian security forces as they crushed the Green protest movement.
Large numbers of protesters were abducted, imprisoned, tortured and sentenced to death.
That is just one of many examples.
Furthermore, with its Action Plan for an innovative and competitive security industry, as it is called, the Commission is promoting these dubious dual-purpose items.
Its stated aim is better exploitation of synergies between security and defence technologies.
We are on the verge of selling out: selling out, quite literally, not only human rights but also our security interests in favour of an industrial policy of dubious worth.
For that reason, I urge you to vote for the amendments tabled by our Group together with the Social Democrats and the ALDE.
