We need a revolution in democracy! Mr President, Commissioner, welcome to the new world of the Treaty of Lisbon. This represents an opportunity for you.
For 11 years, I have been following your reports in this House, and before that as a journalist, and when it comes down to it, they are all very similar.
However, now you have the opportunity to look to the future.
Make use of the professional competence of this House – we are not gathered here today just by chance in this Chamber; I can see Mr Søndergaard and Mr Chatzimarkakis, Mr Staes and on our side, my fellow-combatant Mr Ehrenhauser – and restructure the work of the Court of Auditors.
Take a look at what works elsewhere, for example in Germany, where it is possible to evaluate the cost-effectiveness and meaningfulness of expenditure, and in Austria, and develop
, and develop a concept, perhaps as part of an initiative report from Parliament, which describes how the things that you do can be done much better, so that you can genuinely fulfil your obligations.
