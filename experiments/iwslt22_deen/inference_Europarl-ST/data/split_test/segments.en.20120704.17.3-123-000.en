Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am now speaking here on behalf of my group, and I would like to express support for the motion put forward by Mr Fjellner.
Ladies and gentlemen, we do not have a lot of raw materials in Europe.
The raw materials that we have here are our brains and our creativity.
That means that we need to deal carefully with the subject of intellectual property rights.
The Commission has sent the proposal that has been put to us to the Court of Justice of the European Union with a request for its opinion in order to clarify some outstanding questions.
We simply need to show respect for the supreme court of the European Union and wait for this decision.
There is absolutely no objective reason why we should make this decision today.
No one will be prevented from voting against it once the court has submitted its decision and its opinion.
When we then make our decision, however, we will be making it with a different awareness and a different insight than would be the case today.
Those travelling in the wrong direction on the Internet motorway should not be the ones to decide our policies. I therefore ask you to support this motion.
