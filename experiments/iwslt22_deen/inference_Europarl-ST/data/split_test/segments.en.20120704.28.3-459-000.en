Mr President, as always when Mr Turmes speaks, his words are very intelligent, and I wish that what he said had much more influence on European policy.
I just wanted to follow on from what he said.
Of course, these project bonds are sensible, but only if they are set up in a sustainable way and if we establish a political basis to support them.
By providing guarantees, we run the risk of providing cover for risks that we have no political control over.
Specific examples include the switch to sustainable energy in Germany: a 3 800 kilometre network would be necessary, but only 100 kilometres of the corresponding transmission networks have been built, as this is also being thwarted by resistance from citizens â€“ and, incidentally, very environmentally minded citizens.
We need to think of a political solution to this.
One idea might be for us to establish shared trans-European network corridors, not just combining the high-speed routes for railways and broadband networks, but also perhaps constructing the relevant distribution networks above or even alongside motorways.
That does require much more extensive planning than has been carried out up to now, but I would at least like to take this opportunity to put it forward as a suggestion.
