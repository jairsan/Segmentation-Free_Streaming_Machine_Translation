Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking all my fellow Members from the other political groups who worked with me on this report on Kosovo, as well as Mrs Mahr, who did some very valuable work here in the Secretariat.
I would also like to thank you, Commissioner, for your positive cooperation, and also for doing something you understood to be important, namely, travelling to Northern Kosovo, even spending a night there to make it clear to the population that you are right behind them.
You made a speech at the university and opened EU offices there.
I believe this was an important sign in making clear what the European Parliament stated in the past and reiterates now, namely, its support for an independent Kosovo on its way into the European Union.
We are once again faced with a situation where Kosovo finds itself at a crossroads, particularly in relation to the members of all of Kosovo ’ s ethnic groups.
In a few weeks, the International Court of Justice will decide and give its opinion on the position in relation to the declaration of independence made a little more than two years ago.
I hope that this decision will provide a window of opportunity for placing regional cooperation on a new footing, but starting from the premise of Kosovo ’ s statehood and independence, making it clear that the
Kosovo ’ s statehood and independence, making it clear that the common future for all states in the region – for Serbia, Kosovo and all the others – is as members of the European Union and that the problems that still exist will have to be resolved as they move in this direction.
The wording of the resolution makes it clear: Kosovo ’ s future lies within the European Union.
I am pleased that we have a majority in favour of calling on the five Member States who have not yet recognised Kosovo to do so soon and demanding that the Commission should start the process of visa liberalisation as soon as possible.
It is important that the citizens of the country, in particular, the younger generations, should not be made to feel that they are living in an isolated state, while everyone in the surrounding regions will soon benefit from future changes.
I believe this is the challenge.
I hope that I will also receive a big majority in favour in tomorrow ’ s plenary sitting.
I have also submitted a new amendment that expresses deep regret at the outbreak of violence in recent days and the hope that the matter will be investigated quickly and impartially and will not provide the basis for an escalation of emotions in the coming days and weeks.
