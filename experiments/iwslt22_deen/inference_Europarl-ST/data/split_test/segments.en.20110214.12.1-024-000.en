Mr President, we in the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament also wish to table a motion of this nature.
However, I would like to recommend to Mr Mauro and the House that we formulate it somewhat more precisely.
After all, we have to deal with an enormous influx of people.
I am sure that Italy, like every other country on the Mediterranean, is overstretched in trying to deal with the current problem alone, and she is not the only country facing this massive flow of refugees.
We can assume that Malta, Greece and Spain, too, will be confronted by this problem in the foreseeable future.
We would therefore ask that the title of the debate be very precisely worded so that, specifically, we obtain a statement from the Commission on immediate measures on the part of the European Union to support Italy and other affected EU countries in dealing with the influx of refugees.
