Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, the Commission is, unfortunately, not as adequately represented here today as I would have wished out of respect for Parliament.
As a Member from a region that will be severely affected by the planned changes, namely the Eifel region, I am compelled to ask the question, having followed the debate very closely, whether the, sadly, somewhat inadequate attempt at
standardising the criteria for less-favoured areas really will meet the needs in this region, especially as the information necessary to make a sensible and responsible decision is not available.
Above all, I ask myself whether an adequate impact assessment was actually carried out.
In order to be fair to farmers, we do not just need biophysical criteria; over and above these, we also need socio-economic criteria.
I therefore call on the Commission to discuss the criteria once again, spending the necessary time on these important aspects, separate from the overall package of the common agricultural policy reform and, above all, after submission of the necessary documents and a careful analysis of the impact.
