Mr President, in 2007 and 2008, Libya voted against the United Nations General Assembly resolution calling for a moratorium on executions, and the repeated questioning by human rights organisations elicited no official statements either.
It is therefore very important to us that the names of the people who have been executed are now officially revealed at last.
Any execution is one too many.
We condemn the use of executions and the death penalty.
They are inhumane and cruel, and any execution is one too many.
In our resolution, therefore, we clearly ask that we change this situation and bring it to light and that we now work together to bring about a change here.
No more underreporting. Instead we want transparent information on what happens here and a humane penalty for genuine criminals, but no excessive punishment for those who criticise the regime in Tripoli.
