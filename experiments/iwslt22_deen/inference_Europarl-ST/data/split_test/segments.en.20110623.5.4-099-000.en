Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the importance of interregional cooperation will continue to grow in future.
Cross-border collaboration and macro-regional cooperation are immensely important for the achievement of the Europe 2020 objectives in a Europe which is becoming more cohesive.
Border regions are still faced with particular challenges.
Cross-border concepts and projects in areas such as infrastructure, business cooperation, research collaboration, the development of the labour market and training act as the engine for large parts of the European Union.
We need clear, simple structures for interregional projects.
Different national requirements for the project partners often make cooperation and the implementation of specific, sustainable projects more difficult.
The call in Mr Pieper â€™ s report to extend the proportion of interregional cooperation, Objective 3, to 7% is an important step forward and I strongly support this.
