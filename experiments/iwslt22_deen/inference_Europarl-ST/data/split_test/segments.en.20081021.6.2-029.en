Madam President, I should like to start by objecting to the spirit of something we heard a few minutes ago, namely that our labour market was being overrun by foreign workers.
Secondly, I should have liked to see a clearer, more unambiguous report by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.
Confidence in the social cohesion of the European Union can be achieved only if fundamental social rights are defined as primary European law.
We should send the Council, the Commission, the Member States and the European Court of Justice a stronger signal, and not content ourselves with just calling for a balance between fundamental rights and the freedoms of movement of the internal market.
This will not effect change. Like liberties, fundamental social rights are human rights, and must not be curtailed as a result of internal market freedoms of movement.
The important points here are that we must defend and improve the European social model and that it is high time we introduced a social progress clause as a binding protocol to the existing EU Treaties.
It is time that the Posting of Workers Directive was amended such as to prevent requirements on wages and on minimum standards being limited to minimum requirements.
