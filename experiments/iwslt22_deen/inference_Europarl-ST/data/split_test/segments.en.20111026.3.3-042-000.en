Mr President, for years, the size of the EU budget has been hovering at more or less the same level.
In that time, the responsibilities of the EU have continually expanded and the need for finance has increased significantly.
Thus, financial market supervision made it necessary to establish new institutions.
However, in order for them to be able to carry out their tasks effectively, these institutions need adequate financial resources.
As a result of the financial and banking crisis, the economic weaknesses of some Member States of the EU have become clear.
A comprehensive economic recovery plan would be needed to strengthen the economies of these countries.
Some economic experts even talk of the need for a Marshall Plan for the crisis-stricken Member States.
The EU does not need austerity programmes that impair growth; instead it needs a growth-promoting spending programme that will safeguard jobs and incomes for workers and young people in the EU.
Yet what does the Council do in this situation?
It curtails the Commission â€™ s proposal, which already falls far short of what is needed.
If an appropriate increase in the budget is not feasible in the current political climate, Parliament and the Commission should at least do everything they can to ward off the cuts proposed by the Council.
