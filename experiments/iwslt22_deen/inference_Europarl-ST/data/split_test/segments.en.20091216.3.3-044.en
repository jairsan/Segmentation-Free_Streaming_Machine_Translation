Mr President, we need a revolution in democracy.
That fact that I admire so many Swedish traditions made me all the more disappointed by the overall balance sheet of their activities.
Unfortunately, it was not a presidency of the people, but rather a presidency of the Council and also a large-scale investor presidency in the style of Mrs Wallström rather than that of Mrs Malmström.
Mrs Malmström, I remember you well from the time you were an MEP here.
During this presidency, you have been a rather different person.
I very much hope that when you return, you will pick up where you left off when you were here, namely being inspired by the parliamentary system.
Why did you adopt SWIFT at such a late stage?
Why do we now have a kind of executive board at EU level – this being one of the objectives of the Swedes, of all people, with their transparency?
Please use your future to return to your roots.
