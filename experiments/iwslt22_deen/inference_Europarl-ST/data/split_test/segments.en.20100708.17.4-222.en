Mr President, I voted against the Brok report for four reasons.
The architecture of the service has numerous weaknesses, the details of which still cause us great concern.
The second point is that the European Union ambassador will manage Commission funds in future.
That exposes these funds to numerous risks, and the safeguards against these risks are still extremely unclear.
The third point is the relinquishment of the rights of this Parliament in a Council regulation.
We are de facto codecision-makers in this procedure and yet we have allowed the Council regulation to anticipate our parliamentary rights.
Therefore, as regards my dossier – the Financial Regulation – I would like to say that I do not consider myself bound by today ’ s decisions.
The fourth point is the question of how we actually treat each other in Parliament.
We adopted a parliamentary reform during the last parliamentary term as well as procedures that we have now all trampled underfoot, including with the approval of the Bureau and that of the President.
Why carry out a parliamentary reform that stipulates procedures if, when it matters, we violate these procedures and do not follow them?
For these reasons, I cannot vote in favour of this report.
