Mr President, it is probably pointless, but I would like to issue him with an invitation.
I have never seen him at the discussions on Rio or on other major worldwide conferences, but I always hear him talking here in plenary.
I would really like to invite the honourable Member to come along to committee some time.
Come and argue with us, tell us what you have to offer and then we can talk further with you about the speeches.
The speech that you have just given gives us nothing to work with.
