Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we may have a single internal market, but we have a fragmented supervisory body.
It is obvious that this cannot work.
We need strong central European structures which utilise the expertise and in-depth knowledge of the Member States â€™ agencies, while also having intervention powers to be used in emergencies.
If only in light of the huge tax burden imposed on them by this crisis, citizens are expecting a quick, sound decision to be made in this House without delay.
If there are power games being played at national level merely as to who decides what, this is of little interest to citizens.
What citizens want is for an effective decision to be made to get problems resolved.
Objectively speaking, if measures are required in an emergency, they must be dealt with and a decision made centrally at European level if coordination between Member States is inadequate and does not work.
This is the line taken for decisions made by the G20 and G8, as well as by Heads of State or Government, but unfortunately, this is not the case at Council level.
The Council only takes a narrow-minded approach.
The public do not find this policy acceptable.
We expect the Council to take action.
