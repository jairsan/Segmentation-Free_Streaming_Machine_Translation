Madam President, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, we are in the midst of a major economic crisis – we have been talking about this for months and everything we have said is true – as a rule, however, we tend to talk in very broad terms and then cheerfully continue to make decisions here as if nothing is happening.
I believe this is because here in Parliament we do not act in a specific enough way and we are not honest enough, but rather pursue something resembling a general, headlines policy.
What are we actually doing to promote growth and stability?
Are we ourselves actually contributing to a more proper and wiser way of dealing with finances?
Are we really carrying out a critical review of whether we are making the right kinds of expenditure, or does every one of us not have a new idea every day about where we could spend more money?
If we do not have the strength to focus our financial resources on projects for the future – and that will involve altercations, debates and decisions – then there is no point in talking about innovation and research only to then fail to make the necessary funds available.
That is rather dishonest.
If we want to breathe life into the economy, we must also pursue a policy that stimulates the economy and not endlessly sit thinking about how we can interfere with industry or the economy.
We cheerfully take more decisions – even today we are constantly calling for new decisions that will interfere with the development of the economy.
Does anyone believe that the question of mandatory energy efficiency – to name just one example – will help to drive the economy forward?
Do you really believe that, with the decisions we have often made in connection with energy, we have stimulated the economy?
Or have we obstructed it?
I would like us for once to talk a bit more honestly about this and then to make somewhat fewer decisions, but perhaps ones that will really bring about progress.
That will be more challenging and it will take more effort, but it is in the interests of democracy.
