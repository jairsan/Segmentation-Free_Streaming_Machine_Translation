. Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me start by making it clear that the distribution of food to deprived people is, for me, not at issue in the forthcoming vote on the report by Mr Siekierski, particularly in these difficult economic times.
I would therefore also like to make it clear at the outset that it was not easy to find a common line within our Group.
I therefore respect the personal decision of any member of the Group to deviate from this and not to support our intended rejection of the report.
Why am I unable to support the result of the committee vote as it stands?
There are a number of reasons for this, which have absolutely nothing to do with helping deprived people within the European Union in these difficult economic times.
On the contrary, amendments tabled by my colleague Mr Busk on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, although unfortunately found not to be permissible, were intended to give the existing system a future-oriented foundation.
The system in place up to now is an anachronism from the times of agricultural overproduction, which fortunately are now a thing of the past.
Due to the successful decoupling of direct payments, the intervention stocks have been constantly decreasing in recent years, with the result that, today, up to 85% of the food has to be purchased on the free market.
However, that has altered the fundamental nature of the programme and has resulted in the loss of the agricultural dimension to the programme.
Since we are now dealing with a social programme, we need to create an appropriate legal basis for it.
In this regard, we share the view of the Council â€™ s legal services that the only possible legal basis in place of Article 37 of the EC Treaty regarding the common agricultural policy
possible legal basis in place of Article 37 of the EC Treaty regarding the common agricultural policy is Article 308, as otherwise it would clearly constitute an encroachment on the national competences of the Member States.
In view of the impermissible nature of our amendments, the only solution can be a new draft from the European Commission.
The Commission should also take to heart the principle of co-financing, as whether or not such programmes are meaningful in the mind of everyone can only be satisfactorily assessed at local level.
