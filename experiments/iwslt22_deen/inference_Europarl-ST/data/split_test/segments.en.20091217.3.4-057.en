Mr President, the regional structural funding is an important tool for European integration and the Objective 2 funding in particular has, in the past, been seen as an engine for local structural and economic development by the people in many regions.
It is an important means of managing structural change in the regions and in local authority areas.
This allows citizens to experience Europe at first hand, because the funding has a local impact.
However, we need simpler, clearer and more transparent structures and better controls in the cohesion funds, so that the money is used sustainably and efficiently.
Cohesion, or the convergence of social and economic development, is a major objective of the EU and, therefore, it is important that this instrument is strengthened rather than weakened in future.
The cohesion policy in Europe needs more clarity, more transparency and more efficiency. The individual Member States must also take more responsibility in this area.
This is why it is important to retain the system of additionality in funding.
We do not want structural funding to be renationalised.
Therefore, I would like to ask the Commission to meet these requirements in the funding criteria for 2013.
