Mr President, public procurement law and the awarding of public contracts are an essential part of the internal market.
Mr Barnier, my response to your remarks about wanting to promote social integration in this context is that I have heard very little about protecting social rights or about protecting collective agreements.
These are some of the fundamental rules which you, as you have said, do not want to call into question.
If we want to protect the fundamental rules, we must ensure in future, during the process of awarding public contracts, that basic social standards are maintained, that collective agreements are not undermined, and that the use of cheap labour is prevented.
All of this forms part of modern public procurement law.
I would like to make it clear that we must no longer put greater emphasis on economic freedoms and free competition than on fundamental social rights.
Either we want a social Europe or we want permanent conflict with the people who are turning away from Europe because it does not protect their interests.
