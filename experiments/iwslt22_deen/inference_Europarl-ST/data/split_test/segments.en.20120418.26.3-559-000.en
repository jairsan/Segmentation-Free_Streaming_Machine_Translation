Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this proposal concerning risk sharing instruments will certainly not succeed in preventing state bankruptcy in cases where such an eventuality is almost inevitable.
Nonetheless, it is better to do something than to simply sit on our hands.
Sometimes, unusual situations call for unusual measures.
The budgetary and debt crisis in some countries has meant, unusually, that several important cohesion and structural policy projects and measures cannot be implemented because the banking sector is unable to provide backing and private investors are no longer available.
I see the current proposal for establishing risk sharing instruments for the continued financing of structural policy projects as an extraordinary measure.
The cohesion and structural policies available to the countries that wish to avail themselves of these risk sharing instruments can be used to secure those projects that are already ongoing.
I am very grateful to the rapporteur, Ms Hübner, for making such a valuable contribution in tightening up the details of the Commission ’ s proposal, once again making it clear when and how these instruments are to be used.
I also believe that these risk sharing instruments should only apply in the current situation and should not provide a precedent for the future subsidy period.
