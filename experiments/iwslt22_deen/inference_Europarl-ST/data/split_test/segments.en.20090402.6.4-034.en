Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I fundamentally welcome the European Ecolabel.
It is right that we should make a new attempt to spread the Community Ecolabel further.
I also think it is right that we will be retaining the voluntary nature of the scheme in future.
In future, the label scheme will only be implemented where clear criteria and yardsticks apply, which must be met before the Ecolabel may be used.
In this regard, I call on the Commission to draw up sensible, clear and comprehensible criteria.
The idea of attracting people to the scheme must be at the heart of this.
It would be a great shame if the establishment of the Ecolabel were to fail due to bureaucratic obstacles.
It will be the consumer, at the end of the day, who decides whether the Ecolabel succeeds or fails, as it is with consumers that the scheme must find acceptance.
Attached as I am to the Blue Angel ecolabel that we have in Germany, it must not be a question of personal preference, at the end of the day, but rather it comes down to conveying to consumers at a single glance what specific qualities a product has.
There will only be added value for consumers if the Member States do not use their own symbols and there is ultimately a uniform symbol at the European level.
A jumble of symbols alienates consumers rather than informing them.
One symbol, one conclusion â€“ that is what we should all be working towards together.
