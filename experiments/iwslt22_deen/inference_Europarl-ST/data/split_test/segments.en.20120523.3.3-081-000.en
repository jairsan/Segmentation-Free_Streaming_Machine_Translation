Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with all the problems relating to the details that we could talk about, and which we will be talking about, in the further legislative procedure, we should not lose sight of one thing: financial markets cannot function according to a model in
be talking about, in the further legislative procedure, we should not lose sight of one thing: financial markets cannot function according to a model in which, when everything is going well, the banks take the profits, and then, when something goes wrong, taxpayers have to pick up the tab.
That is why it makes sense for there also to be a tax on financial transactions.
It also makes sense for this to be done in a cross-border arrangement.
In Europe – or at least in the euro area – this would not result in distortions; rather, it would make a lasting contribution to bringing about a stable financial market which generates what financial markets are actually there for, namely, to provide enterprises
access to capital, to allow savers to save or put something aside for their old age, and so that the financial markets can once again do the job for which they were once created, which is to provide added value for the real economy.
Everything that drove us into the financial crisis consisted of products that added no value for the real economy.
That is why it makes sense to have a tax that can be used to help ensure that this is severely penalised, that sanctions are taken, that steers us towards a situation in which capital goes back to doing its job.
That is why I am advocating that we adopt this proposal today with a broad majority.
