Madam President, the gap between the European Union and the citizens of Europe should not be as large as it has become.
We must ensure that this gap is reduced.
The Ombudsman has a very important role to play in this respect, in particular in areas where and at times when he does his job well.
The most important thing is that we can count on the Ombudsman's commitment and sense of proportion.
We must not raise excessive expectations which no one can meet.
On the other hand, it is also about ensuring that abuses which occur in the administration of European bodies are actually dealt with and, where possible, that sensible solutions are sought which will satisfy the citizens and ensure their security.
Until now the Ombudsman has shown that he takes this task seriously and performs it well.
We can only hope that this will continue to be the case and thank him and the rapporteur for this report.
