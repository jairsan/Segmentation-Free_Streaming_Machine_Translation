Madam President, Mr Almunia, ladies and gentlemen, no one disputes the fact that coal is an important part of our energy supply.
It is also indisputable that the mining industry must be competitive and that subsidising it is not the correct approach.
The question now is whether 2014 or 2018 is the right deadline.
Mr Rapkay put forward a number of intelligent arguments which I will not repeat.
I have only one request to the Commission. In all the committees in Parliament which were involved, there is majority support for making competitiveness a criterion.
When it comes to the deadline, we must simply ensure that there is the necessary flexibility to allow the Member States to keep the pressure on the people, the jobs and the economic structures at a manageable level.
The only argument which has been mentioned and which, incidentally, conflicts with the Commission â€™ s impact statement that initially seemed to be in favour of 2018, was that environmental policy reasons could play a role here.
I would like to emphasise once again that it makes no difference to the climate whether we burn imported or domestic coal.
My request to the Commissioner is to consider, if Parliament and the Council can come up with new arguments of this kind, whether this four-year deadline could lead to the Commission being a little more flexible.
This is how I understood the reference just now to the Commission considering the issue and I am grateful for this.
