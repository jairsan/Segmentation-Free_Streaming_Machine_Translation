. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is a really important moment, because today, for the first time in the European Parliament, we are commemorating the Roma and Sinti victims of the Holocaust.
Let me start by with a farewell letter written by a 14-year-old boy, Robert Reinhard, in 1943 before his deportation to Auschwitz from a German children ’ s home.
He wrote: ‘ I have found my parents again.
We are being transported to the concentration camp.
After much soul-searching I have reached the point where I can face death.
Thank you once again for everything that you have done for me.
Greetings to you all. See you in heaven.
Robert.
’ Like 500 000 other Roma and Sinti, this young boy never came back, and although the Roma and Sinti, together with the Jews, were the first victims of production line killing, today – 66 years on – the full truth of what happened remains untold.
The joint culpability of the majority society is also often glossed over.
We need the whole truth about this chapter of history.
The Roma and Sinti must be avenged and the Holocaust recognised as a crime against humanity, to ensure that it can never happen again.
We must fight fervently to eradicate the prejudice against these people.
We must put an end to racial hatred as well as violence, as seen the year before last in Hungary for example, and we should do this with the courage of our convictions.
Freedom, equality and solidarity are not the privilege of a few, but a right for all, because human rights and civil rights are indivisible.
