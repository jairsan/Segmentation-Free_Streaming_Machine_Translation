Mr President, it is clear that this is not about individual facts which we have to discuss but about the fundamental issue of our attitude to democracy and civil liberties.
When we look at the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA), it becomes clear that it is, to a certain extent, symbolic of a lack of transparency and democracy and of the violation of fundamental rights, because it was drawn up secretly behind
secretly behind the scenes using an undemocratic process and because the free use of the Internet was simply no longer possible and neither was there the freedom to use generic medicines to the degree that we currently do.
These are the reasons why millions of people have taken to the streets and have long since anticipated the vote on ACTA.
has already been a vote on ACTA on the streets, on the Internet and in relation to the Committee on Petitions in many countries, not only inside but
also outside the EU. I believe that we must not ignore this vote. It is a demonstration of direct democracy by the many citizens who elected us.
I can only say that we should put ACTA to one side. That is the only decent thing to do.
