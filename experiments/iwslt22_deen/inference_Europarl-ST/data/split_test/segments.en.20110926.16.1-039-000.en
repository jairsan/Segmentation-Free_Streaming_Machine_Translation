Madam President, Ms Geoghegan-Quinn, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to offer my sincere thanks to Ms Matias for this report and to our fellow Members who prepared the earlier reports, Ms Merkies and Ms Carvalho.
This is a continuing process, and the day is approaching when we not only take political decisions here, but also have to demonstrate that we
decisions here, but also have to demonstrate that we mean business when we say that research and innovation are crucial for the future viability of the European Union.
I am therefore very grateful that the representative of the Committee on Budgets also mentioned that adequate funding in this area is an important issue.
We will shortly have to settle the dispute as to whether we have the power to make available the financial resources that are necessary to give this area of research and innovation a truly central importance.
This is of key importance for the question of whether and how Europe will develop in future.
Then, I might add, all the fine and grandiose soapbox speeches will not suffice. Instead, facts will need to be provided.
The second comment that I would like to make is that we ourselves – and this point is developed very nicely in the report – will not be able to avoid looking very closely at whether we cannot use the resources that we have more effectively.
How can we simplify the procedure?
How can we achieve speed?
How can we make research funding more effective?
How can we obtain a stronger structure and greater simplification in what are sometimes still a confusing labyrinth of different types of research funding.
Sometimes, less is more. Few projects but a lot of money invested will have a greater effect in the end.
I am therefore grateful that we have taken things a step further once again with this report.
Of course, the European Research Council and the European Institute of Innovation and Technology will have a particular role to play, and the area of small and medium-sized enterprises is clearly also an important one.
However, last but not least, we must also have a solution for those States that have not yet got very far with regard to the promotion of excellence, which must be extremely compelling and also remain the only principle in future.
The idea of a possible competition with which we could perhaps boost new cutting-edge research centres in neighbouring regions also appears in this report.
This is an important issue that still needs to be resolved.
