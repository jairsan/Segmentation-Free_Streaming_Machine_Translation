Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my question relates to what you think about Iceland and Hungary introducing the euro as a second currency.
Do you think that that could solve the problem of these two countries?
The second question is: do you think that it would be possible to introduce a risk premium for derivatives which would then be used to strengthen the banks â€™ own capital?
My third question is: do you not think that a reduction in value added tax would encourage imports, in particular from China and India?
Would it not make more sense to consider tax reductions for our businesses and for our employees, to pay investment premiums, to focus on progressive depreciation
focus on progressive depreciation and above all to increase assets of a minor value by a factor of ten to avoid taxing fictitious profits and to keep the money in the enterprise, thus also enabling wages to be paid more easily?
