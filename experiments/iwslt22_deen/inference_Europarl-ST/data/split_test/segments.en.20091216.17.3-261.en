My question is this: would it not be sensible to prevent unemployment in the first place?
Do you see any public jobs that could be given to the unemployed?
In particular, how could we boost small and medium-sized enterprises so that new ones are started up?
Are there opportunities here to apply cross-border methods and best practices to create more new companies?
