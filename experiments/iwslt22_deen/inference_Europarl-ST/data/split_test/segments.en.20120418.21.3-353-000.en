Mr President, Mr Daul, I listened carefully to what you said.
What you are proposing – in other words, imposing a growth test on all expenditure alongside the subsidiarity test – means narrowing the objectives down to just growth.
I would like you to tell me how you reconcile that with the manifesto of a Christian Democrat group which still has objectives that extend beyond growth.
