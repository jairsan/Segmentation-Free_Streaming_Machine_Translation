Mr President, I join the rapporteur, Gilles Savary, in expressing my regret that the Commission did not go through with its original plan for an integrated action plan.
There are many good reasons why everyone involved, from local authorities through to the European Union, is trying to improve urban transport conditions.
We know that most people in Europe live in towns and that current transport conditions are anything but optimal.
That is why there is agreement in principle to make integrated proposals at Parliament ’ s initiative on the plan and on Mr Savary ’ s report.
I thank him for his commitment and for his specific proposals.
At the same time, however, I should like to make it abundantly clear that what many fear or believe they should fear will not happen.
No one wants to take the right to configure traffic conditions away from the municipalities or the local or regional authorities.
We merely want to help from the European side to ensure that action is taken on the basis of reasonable common rules where a municipality, a town or a regional entity considers it reasonable.
The principle of subsidiarity is not in danger.
What we want to do here will help to protect that principle.
That is why we shall continue, in the interests of the citizens, to try and ensure that, when a citizen drives another ten or twenty kilometres in Europe, he
Europe, he does not stumble upon a traffic-calming zone which he believes to be the same as in his home district, only to find that totally different rules apply.
No one wants to impose some sort of congestion charge or other rules on communities, but if they are used, then they should be used within a framework which citizens recognise.
We have been in agreement on the sense in taking a common approach to traffic signs for over 100 years.
This should also apply in future to this issue.
