Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think it is good that the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament are looking at this in detail.
However, I would like to say that Parliament adopted a resolution almost unanimously in December 2008 in which we called on the European Commission to submit precisely the sort of proposal that we are now discussing.
Parliament must also stick to what it has itself decided and what has been the declared intention of this House for years.
Because it is only natural for there to be concerns about one thing or another in connection with any legislative proposal, we have resolved the open questions by means of a compromise in the Committee on Legal Affairs.
I should make it clear that this compromise is ready for approval.
Nevertheless, I do understand that it might make sense to enlarge the group that are in support of this report a bit more.
If the efforts of Mr Schulz are aimed at increasing the number of supporters, then I have nothing against a postponement until the next plenary sitting in March.
That is my personal opinion on the matter.
It is not the opinion of the group, which expressly decided otherwise this morning.
However, I think we should give the Socialists a chance to reach a conclusion so that they too can do something to help reduce bureaucracy and the burden on small and medium-sized enterprises.
