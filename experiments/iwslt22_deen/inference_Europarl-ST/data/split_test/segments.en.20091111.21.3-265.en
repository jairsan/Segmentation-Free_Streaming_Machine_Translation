Mr President, the topic we are debating this evening has already been on the European Parliament â€™ s agenda many times.
It is well-known that, in its granting of aid, the Commission is guided by the conditions of the International Monetary Fund.
That has been said a couple of times already.
Against this background, questions have repeatedly been put to the Commission by the European Parliament.
In November 2008, the European Parliament called on the Commission to present an analysis of the effects of the behaviour of banks that, at that time, had transferred their assets out of those Member States that had recently acceded to the EU.
On 24 April of this year, the European Parliament repeated this request.
It also requested to be brought up to speed about the declarations of intent between the Commission and the Member States receiving aid in which the conditions for the aid are laid out in detail.
As far as I know, there has, as yet, been no response to these requests.
Thus, my first question is this: is it correct that these requests have, as yet, not been answered?
If so, then my second question is: why have these requests not yet been answered?
My third question is therefore: when can we expect an answer to these requests?
