Commissioner Hahn, ladies and gentlemen, I have a problem with some of this debate.
Listening to some of the contributions about mountain regions, islands and sparsely populated areas, I get the impression that these are exterritorial and directly subject to the European Union.
That is not the case, however.
Each of these areas belongs to a sovereign Member State.
In accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, the implementation of European decisions and objectives remains a matter for the Member States.
At European level, we have always paid particular attention to precisely these regions – mountain regions, sparsely populated areas, islands – in Commission communications right up to the Treaty of Lisbon.
Here in Parliament, too, many decisions have been made that support these regions.
When I hear so many here complaining that these areas are still in a poor state, then I have to ask myself what the Member States have done with the initiatives that we provided at European level.
What have the regions themselves done with them? How have they used the European assistance provided?
What is called for here is a new strategy, and I feel sorry for the officials of the Directorate General on Regional Policy who have to integrate the multitude of problems suffered by islands, mountain regions and sparsely populated areas into one strategy.
At the same time, there is such strategy inflation – strategies for the Danube, the Baltic Sea, the Black Sea, for climate change and suchlike – that we will soon need a strategy for the strategies if we are to maintain an overview of them all.
Joking apart, ladies and gentlemen, what it is really about – as has been said here today, and I am grateful to Commissioner Hahn for mentioning it – is that we need to fight to ensure that we still have a cohesion policy and a regional policy at European level after 2013.
That is what our work should focus on, and we need to convince our fellow Members of this.
Mountain regions, islands and other areas would all find their place in a continued policy on cohesion and regional policy beyond 2013.
There is no point in wasting our time on individual motions for resolution on this subject.
