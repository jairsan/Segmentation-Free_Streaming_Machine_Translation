Mr President, it is good that integration in the justice sector, hitherto traditionally the preserve of the nation-states, is making progress.
This is consistent with the changes in living conditions of the people of our Union.
However – an observation that has already been made several times – this integration must not intrude too far into structures which have evolved by tradition and, most importantly, which work.
Not everything can be measured by the same yardstick.
The organisation of authentic instruments and public registrars is completely different in many Member States.
In Austria, but not only there, the notary ’ s office enjoys a long tradition and a high level of security and confidence as a public registrars ’ office.
This must not be jeopardised without good cause; that is, merely because such professions do not exist elsewhere.
Therefore, I say ‘ yes ’ to integration and mutual opening-up, but in a balanced way.
