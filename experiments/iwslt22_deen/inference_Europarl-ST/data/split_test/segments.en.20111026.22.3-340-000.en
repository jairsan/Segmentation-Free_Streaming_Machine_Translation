Madam President, I am pleased that, with the report by Ms Angelilli, we have together succeeded in initiating a strong, effective directive, and I would like to thank Ms Angelilli for this.
The directive represents a significant step forward in the fight against child abuse.
However, we must not lose sight of the fact that the vast majority of crimes still take place within children ’ s immediate social environment.
The perpetrators are to be found within their families, in their schools and among their acquaintances.
In this regard, we are still at the start of our work to raise awareness.
Therefore, our children need to be made strong – strong enough to have the courage to confide in someone close to them in an emergency, but also strong enough to recognise dangers such as grooming when using the Internet.
Together, we must therefore ensure that a sense of responsibility plays a greater role when it comes to the use of media in the education of our children.
In this regard, the provision of information is of major importance, as many teachers and parents do not know what it is possible to do with their children ’ s computers or mobile phones.
There is a great deal of catching up to do in this area.
It is therefore to be welcomed that this report also attaches a great deal of importance to prevention, as the authorities, but also schools and families, need to do everything they can to prevent these sorts of dreadful crimes from happening in the first place.
As a result, the EU also needs better strategies for negotiating with third countries, such as the US and Russia.
Websites hosted outside the EU can only be quickly and effectively deleted if we also cooperate closely with these countries in the hunt for the perpetrators and, together, send out a clear signal criminalising the sexual abuse of children.
Up to now, once the perpetrator has been caught, the legislator has, unfortunately, often been surprisingly lenient and most of the penalties have been suspended sentences.
The seriousness of the offence must be given greater consideration in future.
Overall, however, it is important for the public debate to continue, as there are many different dimensions to this issue.
Prevention, the protection of victims, technical development, the principle of deletion rather than blocking, case law, the provision of information and intensive scientific documentation of the facts must also continue to be pursued after the vote tomorrow.
Under no circumstances can we just sit back and relax.
Instead, we need to accept the call to action for us all – every one of us – and work to achieve prevention and the provision of information.
