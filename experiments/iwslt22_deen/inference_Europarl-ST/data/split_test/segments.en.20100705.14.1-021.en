Mr President, I would like to express my group ’ s support for Mr Cohn-Bendit ’ s motion.
Our view of the situation is exactly the same.
This is a highly sensitive and very delicate subject and it certainly makes sense for it to have a broad parliamentary majority.
Therefore, it would be a good idea to postpone the report and to attempt to reach a consensus in various areas where this is still possible.
This is why we are supporting this motion.
