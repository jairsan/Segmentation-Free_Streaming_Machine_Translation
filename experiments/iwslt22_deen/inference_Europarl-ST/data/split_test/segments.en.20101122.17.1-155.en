Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, when you consider how we debated this proposal from the Commission during the last parliament – going from outright rejection to celebrating all the good things coming our way – then I must say that I am very enthusiastic about what has been tabled here.
For this, we owe the rapporteur and his co-rapporteurs a great deal of thanks for having brought together this broad spectrum of opinions into a coherent position.
I feel that the key words here are ‘ patient oriented ’.
In other words, we have not been distracted by peripherals but instead have asked what it is that the patient needs.
I believe it is right that we have established that patients are able to obtain information from a number of channels, not just one.
I should like to reiterate, however, that the doctor must continue to be the trusted point of contact for the patient and must undoubtedly have an influence over decisions.
The way we are guaranteeing that is by banning advertising and ensuring that the information patients receive has been checked and approved by an authority.
This means that the information is based on scientific fact to start with, so patients can rely on it.
Of course, it is true that not everyone is able to find these things out via the Internet.
That is why we have various channels, however, and I think it is so widespread that we do not need to worry about that.
I only hope that the Council will now at last have the courage to deal with this matter.
It is very important; action needs to be taken quickly.
Our patients expect it.
Then we will have done a good job.
