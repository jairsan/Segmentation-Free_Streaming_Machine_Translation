Mr President, Commissioner, President of the Council, I would be glad if we could also find clear signals from the Council in the proposal for 2013
signals from the Council in the proposal for 2013 that show how we in Europe can enhance the potential for growth and competitiveness and, above all, how we can give young people jobs again.
Could it please inform us under which budget lines it intends to promote youth employment and entrepreneurialism and focus on small and medium-sized enterprises?
We know that a target programme is the basic precondition for this â€“ all I see here is cuts by the Council.
The same applies to the Erasmus programme for young entrepreneurs and to the media pluralism programme: there are only cuts here.
Does it think the way to overcome the crisis in Europe is to make cuts in the very areas that guarantee growth and employment?
I heard that the Council was going to put forward growth and employment packages.
Where do we find them in the budget the Council has presented?
