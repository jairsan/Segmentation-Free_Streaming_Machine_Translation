Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the EU Strategy for Central Asia came into being five years ago.
If we look at the state of implementation of this Strategy today, the outcomes are ambivalent.
We see Member States, on an individual basis, endeavouring to cultivate good economic links, particularly with the resource-rich countries in this region, but we also see that the efforts to support these
to support these countries ’ transition to modern, democratic societies are not progressing, or – as recent events in Kazakhstan show – are marred by setbacks.
Despite, or perhaps because of this, the European Union and its Member States must make more intensive efforts to exert influence jointly in the region, particularly in relation to Kazakhstan, which is now one of the main suppliers of oil to numerous EU countries.
Any attempt by the EU to isolate Kazakhstan will simply allow the EU ’ s competitors for influence in this geopolitically strategic country, who attach less importance to urging respect for human and civil rights, to wield even greater influence than before.
Linkage between economic interests and respect for civil rights is at the heart of the EU Strategy for Central Asia.
This should also be the basis for further negotiations on a partnership and cooperation agreement with Kazakhstan.
The present report offers a good framework for this process.
