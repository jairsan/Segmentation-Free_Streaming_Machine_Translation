. Mr President, Mrs Schauvliege, Commissioner, if we are to learn anything from Copenhagen, where you, Commissioner, were of course President, then it should be that the European Union must speak with one voice at such conferences in future.
We may have different opinions here on one or two points, but if we as Europeans are divided in what we say there, we will not be considered credible, and if we are not credible other people will not follow us.
Indeed, why should they?
It is therefore right for the figures we decided on under Chancellor Merkel essentially to be retained and form the basis for this negotiation.
I share your opinion that the ambitious two-degree targets should not now be seriously questioned and a significantly lower degree figure considered, because that will make the ability to meet these targets very much more difficult and people will shy away from us.
I am very concerned that we are putting our intellectual property at risk.
Our industry is investing money and manpower in development.
If we now go and slacken the fence around this intellectual property and leave the holes in the fence that currently exist, then we will lose the valuable elements, namely our intellectual property.
I am all in favour of the transfer of technology, but our enterprises must also see the sense in investing in it, and therefore the intellectual property must not be watered down.
As regards commitments, I am also inclined to demand serious commitments from our partners worldwide.
However, they must be credible and it must be feasible for these countries to fulfil them.
Otherwise they will do exactly the opposite of what we want, in other words they will distance themselves from us.
Presenting ourselves in a credible manner in Cancún is therefore important.
The major decisions will then be taken later in Johannesburg, but we need to prepare the ground in Cancún.
I am a farmer by profession.
If the ground is not properly prepared, there will be no harvest.
Let us concentrate on preparing good ground.
