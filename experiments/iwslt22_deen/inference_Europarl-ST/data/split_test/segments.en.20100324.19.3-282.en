Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the G20 summit in Pittsburgh provided a good model.
It demanded economic recovery plans in order to promote decent work, which will contribute to security and the creation of jobs, and it made the growth of employment a priority.
I therefore call on Europe ’ s labour ministers to press the G20 members, firstly, not to go back on their economic recovery packages, but to work harder and to a greater extent to create jobs; secondly, to work to provide financially secure short-time
to prevent the loss of jobs; thirdly, to promote public investment for the creation of jobs and sustainable ecological growth and, fourthly, to strengthen and extend social security measures to enable access to these measures.
That will also safeguard purchasing power within the internal market as well as employment and will help to combat poverty.
Cooperation with the social partners is apparently very important to Europe ’ s labour ministers in order to strengthen the social dialogue to an even greater extent than desired by the Commissioner.
