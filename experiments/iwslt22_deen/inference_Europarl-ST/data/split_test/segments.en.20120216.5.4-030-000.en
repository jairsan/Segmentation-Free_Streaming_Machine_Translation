Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the nature of the debate in this House shows that we represent the entire spectrum of opinion: on the one side, we have those who do not want restrictions of any kind, while on the other are those who associate any form of immigration with the risk of a massive influx of people.
These are the two extremes to be found within the House.
Family reunification must be viewed with a great deal of common sense and rationalism.
On the one hand, problems genuinely exist in Member States with excessively restrictive policies.
After all, we cannot put so many obstacles in the way of reuniting families that, in the end, reunification becomes an impossibility.
On the other hand, Member States are fully justified in demanding language skills and integration, for example, or at least a willingness to integrate within a state.
Secondly, the Member States naturally have the right to point out the problems that arise with family reunification, problems that should not be swept under the carpet.
If countries like Greece, Malta, Romania or Italy are no longer permitted to indicate the problems they experience in this context, then I am not certain that we are taking a democratic approach by simply ignoring problems.
We do not need another new directive.
We should debate the problems carefully and then consider how we can remedy them.
The continuous production of new directives will not lead to an improvement in the directives or their implementation.
We are currently experiencing implementation problems in some areas.
I completely understand that we need to engage in debate first, rather than drawing up yet another new directive and adding something to it before we have thoroughly discussed the old directive and the associated problems.
I am in favour of listening to the Member States and of respecting the basic right of family reunification.
If this is done in a reasoned and understanding way, then we will also achieve some progress.
