Madam President, this comprehensive report makes clear how many human rights violations take place in the world every day.
This is particularly alarming 60 years after the proclamation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and is a call to us to redouble our efforts.
For this reason, too, I advocate elevating the present Subcommittee on Human Rights to the status of full committee.
Today we awarded the Sakharov Prize to Hu Jia, who champions the causes of human rights and the environment in China.
Since he is in prison, however, he was unable to receive it in person.
This brings shame on China. In addition, tomorrow this House will be debating human rights violations in Russia.
Our relations with both of these countries must attach greater importance not only to economic interests but also, in particular, to human rights.
We call for freedom for Hu Jia in China and for Mikhail Khodorkovsky in Russia.
