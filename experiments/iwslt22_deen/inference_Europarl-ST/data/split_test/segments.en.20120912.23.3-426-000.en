. Mr President, by proposing to shut out developing countries from preferential market access, the Commission is attempting to coerce these countries into free trade agreements.
These free trade agreements are not partnerships, as the term economic partnerships would suggest, but rather are only concerned with the interests of the EU and not the developmental interests of the partner countries.
This runs completely contrary to the EU ’ s objective of reducing poverty and organising all external political instruments in line with this principle.
Countries like Cameroon, Ivory Cost and Namibia would be very hard hit by this restriction.
Regional integration projects, such as those in South East Africa, would collapse if Kenya were to consent to such an agreement.
South-south cooperation would be at an end.
We cannot broadcast the message of free trade to the world with the simple intention that other countries should please buy our products.
If the Commission really believes that trade can promote development, then it should stop blocking it.
The Committee on Development in the House has recommended that the Commission ’ s proposal should be rejected.
We should follow suit in plenary.
