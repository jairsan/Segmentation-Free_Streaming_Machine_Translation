Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, thank you for the generally good collaboration on this report.
We have a Commission proposal that has already made great strides in the right direction but could be further improved in key areas.
In the area of market structures there will be more transparency and there will be greater transparency as part of the MiFID in the area of derivatives trading.
The resolutions of our compromise in the area of high-frequency trading go much further than what the Commission originally proposed and deserve the support of Parliament in their entirety.
The report is moving in the right direction, even in areas that have attracted major public criticism.
In the area of commodities and food speculation the report – after, it must be said, many difficult debates – is much stronger than the Commission ’ s resolutions, since position limits are now established as binding.
However, we need further amendments in this area in order to close some gaps.
I am hoping for additions through the plenary vote and also in the trialogue.
It is pleasing that Mr Barnier has signalled his support of Parliament ’ s detailed proposal.
However, the report does have weaknesses in the area of consumer protection.
That we are now able to ban products is a sign of progress, but we have still made no changes in the area of commission-based advice.
The marketing of financial products is still not orientated primarily towards the interests of consumers but dominated by products with the highest commissions.
Consumers have lost a lot of money in Germany and everywhere else in the EU.
Take open-ended property funds, for example.
For citizens in, say, France, Italy, Spain and Germany, our compromise will unfortunately not change very much.
The basic principle will remain the orientation of products around commissions.
Referring to subsidiarity here is a bit simplistic.
I would have liked to see stronger rules here.
