Mr President, firstly, I would like to thank Mr Hahn, the former Austrian Minister for Science and Research, for starting a new debate which will make a major contribution to promoting growth in Europe.
If every small and medium-sized company in Europe were to create one additional job, we would have no more unemployment in Europe.
Therefore, we should be thinking about how we can enable these small and medium-sized businesses to hire new employees and also to play a more active role on international export markets.
However, the research and transport infrastructures are also important concerns.
The Commission has major tasks ahead of it when it comes to restructuring the East-West connection, for example, from Paris to Budapest, or the North-South connection.
New jobs, which are urgently needed in Europe at the moment, can be created in these areas.
