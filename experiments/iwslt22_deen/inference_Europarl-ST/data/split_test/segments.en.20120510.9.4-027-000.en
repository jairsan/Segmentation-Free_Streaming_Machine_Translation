Madam President, I would like to give you our opinion on the discharge of Europol and Eurojust.
With regard to Europol, there is very little and, in fact, almost nothing, to find fault with.
The annual accounts essentially reflect the financial situation in 2010, and all of the transactions that they are based on comply with the rules and are therefore also legal.
The only things that stand out are the high carryovers compared with the accrued costs, which, overall, are actually low.
Europol attributes this to the move to new headquarters, which is clearly understandable.
However, Europol promises to take additional measures in future to avoid such high carryovers.
In addition, Europol is committing itself to monitoring the implementation of the budget on a monthly basis from 2012 onwards.
I recommend that we check whether that does actually happen.
Against this background, I recommend that we grant discharge to Europol.
Where Eurojust is concerned, the annual accounts also essentially reflect the financial situation in 2010.
All of the transactions here are also legal and compliant with the rules.
However, here too, a high level of operational expenditure was carried forward to 2011.
Eurojust ’ s explanation for this was that it was mainly due to an Organisational Structural Review project – a new computer infrastructure and the costs related to data processing.
The agency has stated that it will improve all of this in future, and that it will also improve its compliance with the tendering requirements.
I recommend that we check this in future, too, and in particular, that we check whether all vacant posts are actually filled in future.
This situation has improved.
However, if these posts are not filled soon, we will have to consider cancelling some funding, and that would have a negative impact on Eurojust.
I nevertheless recommend that we grant discharge.
