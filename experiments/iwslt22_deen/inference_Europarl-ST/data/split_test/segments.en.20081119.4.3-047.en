Madam President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the reality is that the motor industry is in crisis and there are many reasons for this.
The financial crisis, in particular, has further accelerated the crisis in this sector and the Member States are currently working on resolutions.
The European automotive industry is a key industry.
For that reason, we need European solutions for this key European industry in order to defeat this crisis.
Nearly all car makers have European structures.
In order to be able to implement the necessary investment in environmentally friendly vehicles – as has been mentioned a number of times today – and low-consumption technologies, car makers need public guarantees or low interest credit from the European Investment Bank.
The supply industry, too – and this is very important – must not be forgotten in all this.
The supply industry contains small and medium-sized companies in which jobs are created and innovation occurs.
Yet what can the European Union do to protect this key industry?
In the last plenary part-session, the President-in-Office of the Council proposed that key industries should be protected.
For me, this was a good idea, because if you take the proposal to its logical conclusion it means a ‘ Volkswagen Law ’ for the entire European motor industry.
That would certainly be a sound instrument.
The European Commission, however, is currently fighting against this protective instrument.
Therefore, I would ask the Commission this: will it hold its grudge, despite the crisis in the motor industry, or will it change course in light of this crisis?
