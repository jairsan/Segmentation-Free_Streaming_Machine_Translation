recyclability of materials.
Hello, I am Juan López Martínez, I am a professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering and Materials, who develops his teaching and research activity at the Polytechnic School of Alcoy.
we will enter the subject with the first topic, which is introduction to waste.
in this topic we will acquire a series of concepts, define the objectives of what we want the subject to give us.
we are going to talk about waste in nature, waste of natural origin.
we are going to talk about human waste, about urban waste, and finally we are going to talk about industrial waste.
well, the first objective that we have to be clear about is that we are going to approach the issue of waste from a professional point of view.
that is to say, we are going to be people who will integrate into the industry, will integrate into companies, consultancies, administration, and we have to remove a little bit the romantic high that this theme has to focus on professional objectives.
for this the first thing we have to do, and it is, although the definitions I do not like, is to see what we are going to work with, and legislation both European, state or regional, defines us what is a by-product, agreed, which are those wastes, those matters that when we carry out an industrial process are generated and were not what we were looking for, okay.
it differentiates us, too, or defines us what is a residue, which are the materials exactly the same as the by-product, those materials that we do not want, but in its definition what it is going to introduce us are two concepts, which have no usable value and which must be eliminated.
that is going to be crucial for dealing with the waste problem.
finally, the legislation itself defines what it is like to recycle, to recycle is going to be to reintroduce into the production system, and therefore, we here the only thing we can reintroduce are materials that have a certain value, that is, by-products.
schematically, we, our industrial process is going to have a performance and we're going to have a product.
that which does not reach one hundred percent of the yield, that is, the waste, if they have no value we will consider waste, and if they are usable we will simply consider them by-product.
as we have seen, the dividing line between what is a by-product and what is a waste is simply economic.
and that may give rise, in agreement, to a byproduct becoming residue at any given time.
and the clearest example, the one we perhaps all know, was the one that happened a few years ago with the whole mad cow issue.
when we do is take a cow to the slaughterhouse, what we are looking for is a series of products that have an outlet on the market: the fillet, the steak, and in that process, it is still an industrial process, we are going to generate a series of materials or waste difficult to use.
well, it was all about the nerves, the marrow, the viscera...
what happens?
that by-product, what we were doing was recycling it, reintroducing it into the feed itself.
when you get mad cow disease, okay, that ceases to be possible.
we, that by-product, have come to be considered a residue.
not only a waste, which is not used, but also a toxic and dangerous waste.
why?
because it can transmit diseases.
from an economic point of view, being considered a toxic and dangerous waste has an over cost, that is, not only that waste we go, we will not be able to take it to the landfill, but what they do not have to collect authorized carriers, we will have to take it to authorized centers to burn them, and all that carries an added cost.
the problem with this was not so much the loss of the very economic value of these meat waste, of these meat by-products, but the added cost of having to deal with them.
we might think that also from residue to by-product is easy, or it is possible to pass.
there are examples, and many times we see advertisements of this kind, no, try for example from the corfa of the orange, get a biodiesel.
well, here the question is, really when we talk about the corfa of the orange is really a residue, because the corfa of the orange for example can be directly used for animal feed.
so, it is not technically or legally a waste, it is a by-product with low added value.
moving from waste to by-product is going to be very difficult.
as conclusions, what we are going to mark when we are in an industry or a company, or I tell you, simply in the administration, is going to be to avoid waste in the first place.
avoid waste because waste is generated by a low performance of our process.
the less waste we have, okay, it means the more efficient our process is.
secondly, try not to generate waste.
try to generate by-products.
why?
because the waste has an added cost of disposal.
and finally, our third objective, which we will set ourselves from a professional point of view, is to raise the value of by-products.
that is, something they are paying us for equis, trying to duplicate it or triple it, whatever, it's always going to be an economic benefit.
well, this is going to be the first part of this introductory topic, and we will continue with the following topics, thank you very much.
recyclability of materials.
Hello, I am Juan López Martínez, from the department of mechanical engineering and materials, who teaches at the Higher Polytechnic School of Alcoy.
within this subject we find the topic of introduction to waste, and this topic has a series of concepts to acquire.
definition of objectives, waste of natural origin, waste of human origin, urban waste, and industrial waste.
we have seen before, or have previously defined the objectives that we will have in the subject.
and now we are going to focus on what waste of natural origin is.
what are we going to look for here?
what are we going to try to know?
well, it is as important as demystifying the natural concept, that is, we define that we are going to approach this issue from a professional point of view, and we are going to acquire a little culture of what happens in nature itself.
it is paradoxical, uh, that in the waste of nature, we are basically a fruit, uh, of a type of waste that was generated millions of years ago.
all right?
when life is born on earth, what are called bluish green algae are produced, and these bluish green algae generate a toxic residue for them, which is oxygen.
oxygen is a material, it is a poison, oxygen is very reactive.
and this oxygen, uh, wiped out those primitive forms of life.
evolution knew how to take advantage of this residue, and all the living series come from those forms of life that knew how to take advantage of this residue.
we don't need to go so far back, and anyone who is fond of watching documentaries knows that there is a country, which is a country that ecologically suffers disaster after disaster.
and this is Australia.
in Australia, okay, any species that is introduced is going to generate a number of residues.
we all know that in Australia sheep farming is very important.
however, it was not long before cattle were imposed.
why?
for a simple reason, for a reason of waste.
the waste that cattle generate, and if someone has walked through the countryside and seen them, what they do is cover the land, and where they fall they will not generate, or more grass will not be produced.
the residue generated by sheep is much more different and allows the grass to grow again.
Australia did not have ruminant fauna and therefore did not have a whole range of animals capable of reintroducing or recycling such waste.
in fact it was necessary to introduce a whole series of beetles, animals capable of recycling all these waste.
well this, because Australia is Australia, we may seem very distant agreement, but in our own geography it is generated.
there is a process called eutrophication, which is that when the waters have too many nutrients, natural nutrients, there is an excessive growth of algae.
algae develop on the surface, prevent the passage of sunlight, and what is being generated is what is being generated is the corruption of the waters themselves.
that waste, that sky that is being generated does not have oxygen to recycle, to reintroduce those natural nutrients, and it generates what is the death of lakes, rivers and so on.
this occurs naturally in lakes, in rivers that have few slopes.
we all know rivers called the Negro River, the Verd River.
but today, especially in swamps and so on, it is also being generated, and it also affects something that could be considered as natural as aquaculture.
having a whole series of fish in nets locked up, and on these nets we are providing them with feed and the waste of the animals themselves, what is causing is a loss of the seabed, especially what is the part of the posidonia that goes against or is environmentally not positive.
therefore, and we will see it especially throughout the course and when we talk about materials, we have to have certain conclusions.
and so these conclusions are that residues are going to be inherent in any process, including natural ones.
we are not going to be free from environmental disasters simply because we use natural products.
the second problem is accumulation.
as long as we do not solve the problem of accumulation, what we are going to have are short- and medium-term problems.
and finally, as has been said a little at the beginning, the natural is not exempt from causing environmental problems.
well, we end this part here, thank you very much, and we will continue with the subject.
recyclability of materials.
Hello, I am Juan López Martínez, a professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering and Materials who teaches at the Polytechnic School of Alcoy.
we are, within this subject, talking about topic one: introduction to waste.
in this topic, which basically consisted of five concepts to acquire, to define.
we are first of all defining the objectives that we have already achieved.
we have talked about waste of natural origin, and now we are going to talk about the history or development of waste of human origin.
we will see or try to know the trajectory of the problem of this type of waste.
and so, when these types of waste begin to be generated, well, these types of waste begin when we human beings begin to agglomerate, that is, when we begin to generate the first cities.
the first cities or the first civilization that has a concept of city very similar to that we have is the Roman civilization, in Rome, and Rome is, in Rome is known what is called the Eighth Hill, Mount Testaccio.
Mount Testaccio, which it is, is simply an accumulation of the waste that the city of Rome generated.
all the amphorae of wine, oil that mattered.
then they went to a landfill, which is preserved today, so, finally, especially the archaeologists are delighted.
well, this concept of a city that the Romans have, a city of services, when their civilization disappears, it also disappears.
and, in the middle ages, we find that cities are simply agglomerations of human beings.
they are agglomerations of human beings where there is no public service to them, that is, there is no garbage collection, there is no sewerage, and that is also going to generate certain facts that we all know.
one of them, or perhaps the most important, was the appearance of bubonic plague.
the bubonic plague took almost a third of the population of people, that is, to think that of every three people, one died.
and why was it generated?
because it was generated, above all, by the waste that people accumulated in their homes, in the streets, the proliferation of rats that later transmitted this type of disease.
well, we can think that we are talking about the middle age, that is, we are still talking about very distant times.
but to think that among a thousand seven hundred, a thousand eight hundred, there is an expression that I do not know if you have heard it, which is "water goes."
what does "water goes" mean?
well, when you had to, in the cities, a city like Madrid, capital of an empire, that is, it was not a small town, when you had to get rid of its human waste, you would open the window and just throw them out of it.
and I tell you, that was it, we are talking about two hundred, two hundred and fifty years ago.
only from a thousand eight hundred, with the development of cities like Paris, is where that feeling of urbanism, eh, of public services, waste collection, begins to develop.
well, if we are talking about urban waste, okay, with industrial waste the problem gets even worse.
it has taken a whole series of natural disasters for us to become aware of this.
the first documented natural catastrophe generated by waste occurs in Japan, in the Bay of Minamata, where in a fishing village begins to appear a series of symptoms, that is, a disease that is similar to saturnism.
saturnism what it does is that you lose all that is locomotive capacity.
Japan, Japan is the first world, it's like Europe, it's like the United States, and obviously these things don't go unnoticed.
a number of scientists dealt with the case in nineteen thirty-two, and also discovered that this phenomenon of saturnism affected, above all, the inhabitants of the village and the cats.
what was the problem?
the problem is that the basis of feeding these fishermen and their pets fish.
the fish what was accumulating was the mercury that, a nearby company, poured into the bay.
the accumulation of mercury will cause this disease.
well, it took about sixty, well not so long, about forty years to hold the company accountable, that is, it was not an immediate case of solution.
more recently in time, we find facts like what happened in Seveso, in Italy, where a truck loaded with dioxins overturned.
imagine an industrial region like Alcoy and surroundings that has to be completely evacuated.
and finally, or one of the last major disasters due to industrial waste, is the tragedy of Bhopal, eh, which is the tragedy that has generated the most deaths from industrial waste.
it's the worst disaster that's ever existed.
well, that has meant that of all the types of waste that we are going to find are industrial, mining, forestry, agricultural... It is mainly urban and industrial solid waste that will affect us the most.
as conclusions, we really must never forget that waste is a real danger, regardless of whether we throughout the course are always looking for profitability, or a professional point of view on the subject of waste.
we also need to be aware that awareness of the problem is relatively recent, uh, don't think it's all done.
and that, in addition, and this should concern us, if we are in any industry in the first world, that is, in Europe, the United States and Japan, any problem generated by waste will have a strong impact.
well, commented this, or made this little introduction, thank you and we will continue in the next stages.
recyclability of materials.
Hi, I'm Juan López Martínez, a professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering and Materials at the Alcoy Higher Polytechnic School.
within this subject, we find the topic one that is an introduction to waste.
of the different sections or concepts to be developed in this area, we have already seen the first three, as the definition of objectives, we have talked about waste in nature, we have talked about the history of waste of human origin, and now we are going to deal with urban waste.
what are we going to see from urban waste?
it is simply a question of knowing a little about the problems of this type of waste.
well, urban waste, we are going to find only what, is all that is household waste, but because all that is that waste that is going to be generated within the city.
eh, so road cleaning, commercial waste, abandonment of dead animals, belongings... even, and less and less, the municipalities if they have an industry in the urban center, must take care of their waste.
well, the waste we generate is going to depend mostly on our way of life.
we have gone from generating in one thousand nine hundred and ninety practically three hundred kilos per year, to generating two thousand to five hundred kilos per inhabitant per year.
what has happened in that period of time?
in that period of time our standard of living has risen.
also, a little this can be seen between the waste they generate, which generates an inhabitant of a rural area, and an urban area.
while the inhabitant of the rural area is generating between half a kilo to eight hundred grams inhabitant day, that of the urban area generates practically double.
well, it 's interesting to see that we, for example, compared to countries that have a higher standard of living, sorry, similar, are generating the same amount of waste.
that is to say, in Europe, the average amount generated is approximately three hundred kilos.
if we were to see that graph there, we would see that practically everyone is the same, although the generation of waste from the United States stands out a little.
well, statistics are often the big lies.
we, seeing those charts, and as Europeans, we can say, jo, that the Americans are nasty.
but, keep in mind that the way of life in the United States is relatively different from the way of life that we can have in Europe or Japan.
while in Europe and Japan, we live mostly in what are buildings, flats.
in America, in any movie you see, The Simpsons, whatever it is, they have the tendency to live in one-man houses.
and what happens?
they count everything that is the generation of pruning waste, grass waste, branches and so on, they count it.
and that is why the percentage of waste we can see generated by the United States is much higher than ours.
if we discounted that kind of residue, they would be practically on the same level.
well, not only do we generate the same type or the same amount of waste, but also the composition of this waste is going to be practically similar, regardless of the country where we are.
basically, we are going to have about fifty percent of the waste that is going to be organic matter, and about thirty, thirty-five, are generated by the packaging.
that is to say, plastic, glass, metallic containers, and practically twenty percent are already diverse products.
we therefore have to conclude that, when we are going to tackle the problem of urban waste, it is that urban waste simply depends on the way of life we live.
in fact there are companies that from waste can tell us what is our way of life, if we are married, if we are single.
they are globalized, that is, we generate a person in an urban center of Spain generates the same waste as a German, as a Japanese, and well, their recovery, okay, this uniformity, what is going to give us are great opportunities for recovery.
if we, this waste, apply good management, it will be an important source of resources that we must not discard for the future.
with this we are going to end the issue of urban waste, and we will end the introduction by talking about the other type of waste that is going to be very important to us, industrial waste.
thank you.
recyclability of materials.
Hello, I am Juan López Martínez, a professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering and Materials who teaches at the Polytechnic School of Alcoy.
we are talking, within this subject, about the introduction of waste.
and we have already seen that this subject, which in this subject was raised a series of concepts.
how they were to define the objectives of the subject.
talk about waste of natural origin.
talk about waste of human origin.
then focus a little on urban waste, and finally we are going to talk about industrial waste, which is, along with the previous ones, the most important to us from an engineering point of view.
what is the problem with these industrial wastes?
well then, industrial waste, in principle, the first thing they mean, all right, is that we are doing something wrong.
all right?
when we are doing a process and we generate waste is that we are not taking advantage of a raw material.
that would be the least evil, that is, the raw material that is lost, uh, we would be talking about waste that is inert, that is not going to generate, that is not going to generate any environmental problems afterwards.
we are going to lose matter, we are going to have to manage them, and well, every day more, it is more difficult to find a way out for this type of waste.
the municipalities obviously refuse to receive this type of waste, although they are inert, simply because of the problem of landfill.
but in addition to these inert residues, what we are going to have are another series of residues that are toxic and dangerous.
this waste actually accounts for a small percentage of the waste generated by the industry, it is around thirteen percent.
but since they are substances that can harm both human health and the environment, they are very well controlled, all right.
its disposal and management is costly.
they are also subject to very strict regulations, and we must allocate financial resources to ensure that this regulation is complied with.
we have to have them stored in special places, we have to collect authorized managers, and above all, also, a very important thing, as we have any accident we are going to have a very important civil liability, which, well, it can even become a criminal liability.
well, this kind of waste, okay, unlike urban waste, is going to depend a lot on the kind of industry we have in the area.
and here, in the face of the uniformity of urban waste, where everyone, or everyone in the first world generated more or less the same type and quantity of waste, here we already find great differences between countries.
the United States is a great generator of waste, in this case they have no excuse, the area of everything that is the great lakes, border with Canada, have a very high pollution, there are rivers that burn.
and then, for example, we find ourselves in agreement with countries that are relatively similar, such as Belgium and the Netherlands, that is, in terms of lifestyle, economic situation, and that, well then, Belgium, for example, has an important chemical industry, and that makes it very high in terms of its production of hazardous toxic waste.
the same goes for Sweden, which has mostly what is the paper industry, which also generates a lot of waste.
countries like Switzerland, of course, where the industry is relatively clean, because its generation of waste is very low.
it should be noted that these statistics, which are from ten years ago, were curious as in Spain, in all these statistics, it was listed, it was listed as a really clean country, we did not generate toxic and dangerous waste.
well, we did a study on the companies of the, on a playful industrial zone, of Ibi, and composed mainly of small and medium-sized companies, and really what was happening is that in this country because we are a little late in all that subject.
ten years ago, we asked ourselves if it was a study of two hundred companies, if they had environmental management procedures in place, almost none of them had.
quite simply, the fact that if they knew about the existing legislation on toxic and dangerous waste, almost eighty, almost eighty percent did not know it, they simply did not know it, and they were only twenty-two percent aware of it.
and well, if it simply met the minimum requirements, which is to be registered as a producer of toxic and dangerous waste, comply with the law, because basically, it was only thirteen percent.
given that situation, what we did was a campaign in the companies themselves, especially indicating the civil and criminal responsibilities that they had for not complying with the law, and well, because practically that situation is improving.
nowadays, even when we pass by a mechanic's workshop, because we already see how the collection of the used oils themselves already applies the existing legislation.
well, in this type of, in this type of waste, as I have indicated what counts is mainly the type of companies existing in an area, and we are going to have above all that everything that is chemical industry, paper, leather, and metal products, especially metallic baths, are going to be the main producers of this type of waste.
virtually no company will be spared from generating toxic and dangerous waste.
to think that all that are solvents to clean parts, oils from machines, even the rag with which we clean the machine, all that is considered, all right, toxic residue, and dangerous.
of course, there are companies that are more, that are more susceptible, or that are going to generate more, and other smaller ones.
for example, one of what they are, they are usually cleaner, they are plastic forming industries, because basically there is the toxic and dangerous residues are usually the oils and coming from the machines, and packaging that we use with some solvent.
if, for example, in that plastic forming industry, what we already have is a painting process, there the toxic and dangerous waste that we are going to generate is going to be greater.
the sludge of the paint booths, the paint containers are toxic and dangerous waste, and well there are the hooks where we are going to hang the piece to paint, over time it is going to be considered a toxic and dangerous waste.
well, by Autonomous Communities, because we have that as more industrialized, more toxic and dangerous waste generate, and well so Catalonia, which is the one that has a major chemical industry, will lead this ranking.
the Valencian Community, despite being industrialized, we have companies that generate little, generate little waste, and we are not the most worrying.
what I have told you is that any company, okay, is going to have to at least not only treat this waste, but make a declaration to the industry of the waste it generates.
in that statement, which is relatively straightforward, for small producers.
well, a company of fifty workers, which transforms plastic, and which is a carpentry shop, which transforms metal products...
what we are going to have to give good because it is the data of the company, of its representation.
we are going to have to give data on our energy consumption, the number of workers we have.
because that's going to focus the administration, it's going to tell you if what we are if the waste we're declaring is consistent with our actual production.
we will have to indicate the raw materials consumed, and we will also have to indicate the waste we generate.
with the data of energy consumption, number of workers, production, raw materials consumed, because more or less the administration already has some scales and knows if our declaration is true.
apart from those products, what we are going to have to give to that administration is all the management data that we are, that is, who our managers are, that is, when we produce the waste, who and when and how it comes to collect it, and well, from there because we have already complied with the law, we can face any inspection.
well, then, as conclusions, this kind of waste is going to depend on the type of industry we find.
waste, especially toxic and dangerous waste, is going to be treated in a very special way.
then we will go deeper, but well, in an industry, when we generate a toxic and dangerous waste I can tell you that we can only store them.
and, and this we do have to be very clear, there is no industry that does not generate toxic and dangerous waste, because already simply the oil of a machine is considered a toxic and dangerous waste.
well, with this information that we have just seen, we will close this topic, which is a more or less philosophical, cultural introduction, as you want to call it, to the issue of toxic and dangerous waste, and from now on because we will begin to see the issues where with a more technological character, we will see what possible solutions we will give to our waste.
thank you.
the topic that we are going to see now is amino acids and proteins: qualitative identification.
the objective of this topic is to verify that through simple tests it is possible to demonstrate the presence of amino acids or proteins in different samples.
it is necessary to start with a review of basic concepts and we will start by seeing what proteins are.
the most surprising thing about proteins is the diversity of their functions in living things.
we see that they have catalytic function, since almost all enzymes are proteins, they also act have function of immunoglobulins that are antibody proteins that are created in response to some antigen, that is, they act within the immune system.
then, they also have transport function, movement of materials, the clearest example would be hemoglobin that transports oxygen, has regulatory function, constituents of hormones, control of metabolism, have structural function, since they constitute the function of wrapping and support: the skin, tendons, hair, nails and bone.
and they also have the function of acting on the movement, they are part of muscles, cilia and flagella.
the key to the diversity of its functions, of course, lies in its structure.
the...
to explore the structure of proteins we will first look at the fundamental building blocks that are alpha-amino acids.
amino acids are carboxylic acids that have an amino group.
amino acids can be classified into alpha, beta, gamma and so on according to the position of the amino group in the carbon chain contained in the carboxyl group.
here is an example.
this would be an example of an alpha-amino acid, this one of a beta and this one of a gamma.
if you look at it, it occupies the third position: alpha, beta and gamma; with respect to the carboxyl group.
the first is called an aminocyclopropanocarboxylic acid and is an alpha-amino acid precursor, which is the biological precursor of ethylene in plants.
an example of beta-amino acid would be the three aminopropanoic, which is what is normally known as beta-alanine.
it is a beta-amino acid constituting the structural units of coenzyme A.
and finally the example we have given of a gamma-amino acid is the four amino-butanoic, which is a gamma-amino acid that is involved in the transmission of the nerve impulse.
well, despite being known more than seven hundred natural amino acids all the amino acids from which they derive proteins are alpha-amino acids.
and all except the proline.
proline is an alpha-iminoacid, that is, its amino group is secondary, while all others contain the primary amine function that adapts to this general structure.
it has the carboxyl group, the amino group in ionized form, and this radical.
under certain conditions the amino group of a molecule and the carboxyl group of a second can react and then bind two amino acids.
the type of bond, the type of bond, is called amide bond.
here you have two alpha-amino acids, the carboxyl group and the amino group in ionic or ionized form, and here you have the other.
notice that this amino group reacts with this carboxyl group and this bond is formed, which we call amide bond, better known as peptide bond.
here a dipeptide would be formed, if instead of joining two amino acids three would be a tripeptide, if four tetrapeptide are joined and so on.
polypeptides, as you may have deduced, contain many units of amino acids.
proteins are natural polypeptides that contain more than fifty units of amino acids, most are polymers of one hundred to three hundred units...
they contain 100 to 300 units of amino acids.
as mentioned above, proteins of any biological species are formed by twenty alpha-amino acids, which differ only in the R group.
this group here.
humans have the ability to synthesize some of the amino acids but there are others that do not, and they must take them in their diet.
this type of amino acids are called essential amino acids, and here you have those that are: histidine, arginine, lysine, threonine, tryptophan, phenylalanine, methionine, isoleucine, leucine and valine.
for the qualitative identification of both amino acids and proteins it is necessary to know the chemical properties, since all that identification is based on the chemical properties of these compounds.
amino acids repeat the properties of the functional groups that they possess, and you all know that they contain the carboxyl group and therefore they will have reactions such as formation of esters, amides and reduction...
they also possess the amino group, then they will possess the typical reactions of the amino group: rent, acillation, reactions with aldehydes and ketones, with nitrous acid and the others that you have already studied.
and then, also the reactions of the side chain, for example: oxidation of the mercaptan group, in the case of cysteine, formation of mercaptides with heavy ions, such as two positive mercury and two positive lead, and reactions of phenols in the case of tyrosine and alcohols in the case of serine and threonine, and so we could continue.
the tests we are going to see are some basic and widely used qualitative tests.
the first of these is the Biuret test.
the Biuret test consists of copper sulfate which is found in basic medium and serves for the identification of peptides and proteins.
it is based on the ability of peptides to hijack the basic medium and Cu2 ions more, and results in a purple coordination complex.
the complex is formed by the interaction of peptide bond groups, of peptide NH groups.
that is, they come from the peptide bonds between amino acids and that is the union or interaction of these NH groups of the peptide bond with the Cu2 ions more present in the solution.
the maximum absorbance, of the complex, is obtained between three hundred and thirty-five hundred and forty-five nanometers.
sensitivity is greater than three hundred and thirty but is usually measured at five hundred and forty-five nanometers because the number of interferences is lower.
another widely used test is the ninhydrin test.
amino acids react or interact with ninhydrin, or alpha-amino groups, but do not interact with the nitrogen in peptide bonds, so the ninhydrin test serves to identify the presence of amino acids but not the presence of proteins unless they have undergone a prior process of hydrolysis.
and this happens at acid pH.
ninhydrin when reacting with alpha-amino acids forms a color, a complex of bluish purple color, and the maximum absorbance is in five hundred and seventy nanometers.
here you have the alpha-amino acid, the ninhydrin and the type of complex that forms, as a result of the reaction an aldehyde and carbon dioxide or carbon anhydric is released.
in the case of proline and hydroxyproline that the amino group you know was a secondary amino group, that is alpha-iminoacids, the complex that is formed does not have bluish purple color but yellow color.
the ninhydrin test is very important and is widely used in, it is widely used in both quantitative and qualitative determinations, and in amino acid analyzers, it is used to identify amino acids and also serves to, for example, reveal the presence of amino acids when you do a chromatography.
another test is the Millon test.
the reagent used in this test is a solution of mercuric nitrate in nitric acid, and when a dissolution of proteins is heated in the presence of this reagent appears a red color due to the formation of a coordination complex, by the interaction between the phenolic groups of amino acids, the case of tyrosine, and the mercuric cation of the reagent.
so, we will recognize this side to recognize all those amino acids that have phenolic groups.
the test called xanthoprotein, the reagent used is concentrated nitric acid...
and then, this test positive all those amino acids that have aromatic groups, for example phenylalanine, as they are nitrated in the presence of concentrated nitric acid.
the product of the reaction gives a slightly yellow coloration.
with this we have finished the topic of amino acids and proteins: qualitative identification.
the topic we are going to see today is called Carbon hydrates: qualitative identification.
the aim of this topic is to describe different simple chemical tests to quickly identify the presence of certain carbohydrates and also to review the chemical properties on which these qualitative tests are based.
let's start by doing a brief review of basic concepts.
we will see some definitions, then also what the glycosidic bond consists of and what are called reducing sugars.
we start with definitions, and the first of these is to see what carbohydrates are.
carbohydrates are aldehydes and polyhydroxyl ketones.
those derived from aldehydes are called aldosas, and, for example, we have glucose and galactose, which have six carbons, and ribose, xylose and arabinose, with five carbons.
here I have given you the example of xylose.
represented in Fisher's structure, and then the eclipsed conformation of that same carbohydrate.
well, those derived from ketones are called ketoses, for example, ribulose and xylulose, which have five carbon, and fructose, which has six carbon.
whose linear formulas, or represented as Fisher, you have them here below: ribulosa, xilulosa and fructose.
OK...
notice, most carbohydrates, both aldosas and ketose, are presented as cyclic hemiacetals.
and that is because both the aldosas and the cetosas incorporate, have within their structure, a carbonyl group and a hydroxyl group, which can react, are able to react to each other through a reaction that is called nucleophilic addition, therefore they form what is the cyclic hemiacetal.
if the hemiacetals are five limbs they are called furanoses.
look at this example, it is the same structure as the previous one, the same carbohydrate, the xylose, in its eclipsed representation.
note, that, in order for the OH group to react with the carbonyl by means of this reaction that we have mentioned before of nucleophilic addition it is necessary that they are close.
that requires a twist between carbon three and carbon four for the OH group to be close to the carbonyl group.
it is what you can see has happened in this sequence.
once it is close, the reaction occurs and then the aciclation occurs.
as it derives from xylose, it is called xylopuranous.
OK...
in the case of the six-member hemiacetals, the six-member hemiacetals are called pyramids.
because of the type of cycle it represents.
here I have given you the example of dextro-glucose, and those involved in this type of reaction are the hydroxyl group of carbon five and the carbonyl group of carbon one.
notice the eclipsed form, that this conformation is not adequate for the reaction to occur, because as we have commented previously this hydroxyl group is not close to the carbonyl group with which it has to react.
therefore, a rotation has to take place between ce four and ce five, that is, between ce four and ce five, so that the OH, the hydroxyl group, is close to the carbonyl group.
once they are close there is the reaction and therefore the aciclation.
as it derives from glucose it is called glucopiranosa.
ketose also appear mainly as cyclic hemiacetals.
an example would be dextro-ribulose or dextro-fluctose.
whose structures, this is the eclipsed form, you have it here...
as the hydroxyl group reacts with the carbonyl group to form the furanosa ring the aciclation.
what do the alpha and beta symbols mean, which you have seen both in the structures of the carbohydrates previously cycled, and in these examples that you have under transparency?
as the alpha and beta symbols always refer to the anomeric carbon and refer to the position of the hydroxyl group of carbon one with respect to the CH2OH substitute of carbon five, in this case.
when both the hydroxyl group and the CH2OH group are on the same side of the plane, that is, when they are in the cis position, then they are called beta, and when they are in the trans position, which is this example, then they are called alpha anomalous.
now let's see what glycosides are.
glycosides are an important class of carbohydrate derivatives, and are characterized by the substitution of the anomeric hydroxyl group by some other substituent.
they are called either O-glycosides, ene-glycosides, or that-glycosides, depending on the atom attached to the anomeric carbon.
normally the term glycoside without prefix, without any prefix, means that we are referring to O-glycosides, that is, those that have the oxygen atom attached to the anomeric carbon.
structurally, O-glycosides, or glycosides from now on, are acetals in which the anomeric hydroxyl group has been replaced by an alcoxyl group.
if you look here this would be the already aciclated glucose form of pyranose.
as its hydroxyl group has been replaced by an alcoxyl group.
always giving off water.
OK...
disaccharides are carbohydrates in which two monosaccharides are joined by a glycosidic bond.
polysaccharides have many units of monosaccharides connected by glycosidic bonds.
complete hydrolysis of these disaccharides and polysaccharides breaks down glycosidic bonds by releasing monosaccharides.
here you have the example of lactose, and here that would be the glycosidic bond.
well, once we have seen this brief review of the most basic concepts, we 're going to go into the identification of carbohydrates.
we will briefly discuss identification techniques and also qualitative tests.
the current techniques for determining the chemical structure of carbohydrates are essentially the same as those used for any other type of compounds.
modern instrumental methods are: mass spectrometry, nuclear and infrared magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and when the substance is unknown, forgive me, when the unknown substance is crystalline then we can use X-ray diffraction spectroscopy.
but before this wide availability of instrumental methods existed, the main approach in determining the structure was based on a series of reactions and chemical tests.
the response of an unknown substance to various reagents and procedures provided information on its structure.
so you should make a brief review, or review, of any of the reactions of carbohydrates, for example hydrolysis, dehydration or oxidation reactions that suffer.
now we are going to try fully a series of tests by which the qualitative identification of some carbohydrates is carried out.
you know that certain carbohydrates can be detected by those types of qualitative tests that depend mainly on differences in chemical structure.
the tests that we will see are the Molisch test, the Barfoed test, the seliwanoff test and the Bial test.
the Molisch test is based on the effect of concentrated sulfuric acid on carbohydrates.
the acid hydrolyzes any glycosidic bonds that are present, and dehydrates them to monosaccharides, and dehydrates monosaccharide to its corresponding furfural derivative.
pentoses pass to furfural while hexoses form hydroxymethylfurfural.
these derivatives condense with alpha-naftol and produce a blackish brown color by which they can be identified.
the Barfoed test makes it possible to distinguish monosaccharides from disaccharides.
it is very similar to the Fehling reagent that you know is ion or cupric cation complex with tartrate, or also to Benedict's reagent, which is also Cu2 ion more complex with citrate ion.
well then, the Barfoed test in the presence of these positive Cu2 cations what happens is that the carbonyl group of monosaccharides oxidizes to acids while the Cu2 cation more reduces to cuprous oxide.
that produces a red precipitate.
this reaction is also produced by disaccharides that have a reducing character, such as lactose, although it is produced more slowly.
it can be produced if it is found enough, that is, in acidic medium with sufficient concentration...
because then the hydrolysis of the disaccharide occurs, or when it is subjected to prolonged heating times.
here you have the reaction that monosaccharides suffer in the presence of Cu2 more as it happens to acid, it oxidizes, while Cu2 more is reduced to Cu more.
so this test is always given by reducing sugars, which as you will know are those whose carbonyl group is aldehydes, that is, always give aldosas, and some ketose if it exists in balance with the aldehydic form.
the seliwanoff test is based on a reaction similar to that of the Molisch test.
in acidic environment the monosaccharides are dehydrated giving rise to furfural derivatives and the disaccharides are hydrolyzed and dehydrated.
furfural derivatives can then interact with guayacol, which is present in the seliwanoff reagent, and form a red-colored complex.
this test can be distinguished...
it makes it possible to distinguish between ketose, such as fructose, and aldosas, such as glucose, since the reaction is much faster in ketose than in aldosas.
and finally the Bial test.
it consists of orcinol that is mixed with iron trichloride.
well, in the presence of orcinol and in a strong acid medium the pentoses become dehydrated giving rise to furfural, while the hexoses give rise, as we have already mentioned, to hydroxymethylfurfural.
then the furfural can interact with the iron trichloride, which is in the dissolution of orcinol and produces a greenish coloration, while the hydroxymethylfurfural produces a brown color, therefore they can be distinguished with this test between pentoses and hexoses, by the different coloration of the formed complex.
OK...
with this I conclude this brief review on carbohydrates and qualitative identification.
well, now we're going to deal with another issue, which is oils and fats.
and we 're going to focus on determining the iodine index.
it is advisable, as in the previous topics, to make a brief review, a brief review, of the basic concepts.
but first let's look at the goal.
the objective is to know the procedure to determine the iodine rate of different fats and natural oils, as a means to differentiate the degree of saturation of fat matter.
the revision of these concepts that we were talking about begins with the distinction that is made between fats and oils, since it is a little arbitrary.
at room temperature a sample is said to be fat if it is solid and oil if it is liquid.
most animal glycerides are fats, but vegetables are usually oils.
there are some exceptions such as cocoa butter and fish oil.
fats and oils are triglycerides, i.e. glycerin esters.
glycerin you all know, or you must remember, that it is propanotriol.
this esterification is done between glycerin and long chain carboxylic acids, which are called fatty acids.
the general structure of triglycerides is this and they are called the extremes of propanotriol, that is what it has esterified, of alpha alcohol, to the extremes, and beta to the central.
look at the fatty acid is long chain, the glycerine that as we have discussed is propanotriol, and triglyceride as it has formed.
the carboxylic acids that are obtained by hydrolysis of a fat or an oil are called fatty acid, and it has a very long chain as we have commented without ramifications.
it usually also has an even number of carbon atoms.
the general chemical structure could be represented as you have in that box.
there are two types of fatty acids: saturated and unsaturated.
the saturated ones are those that do not possess double bonds, an example would be the laurico.
and the unsaturated are those who at least have a double bond, for example the palmitoleic.
monounsaturated is when they only have a double bond and polyunsaturated when they have two or more.
saturated fatty acids have no isomy, as simple bonds can rotate freely.
the structure is linear, and fits very well with each other.
they have a high melting temperature, therefore they are solid at room temperature and are quite unreactive.
here you have the example of stearic.
note also that it has a polar end and an apolar end.
the polar is the carboxyl group.
regarding unsaturated fatty acids, comment that they do have cis-trans isomy, and the natural ones are normally cis.
the presence of double cis links are the...
the presence of the double bonds and in cis position are the cause of an alteration in the linear form moving to angular form with formation of elbows and changes in the direction of the double bond.
look...
this would be a saturated fatty acid and this one unsaturated.
unsaturated fatty acids have a low melting temperature and are therefore liquid at room temperature.
normally the natural fatty acids, as we have commented, are cis, but what happens is that by increasing the temperature by industrial processes can produce the passage from cis to trans, which would increase the temperature of fusion.
in short, when it passes from cis to trans, it changes from liquid to solid.
here you have the example of oleic and elaidic.
here you have also, I have given you, an example of the structure of unsaturated fatty acids, for example: linoleic and arachidonic.
be extreme polar and all the rest apolar.
as for its properties tell you that unsaturated fatty acids are very reactive, due to the presence of double bonds.
and therefore they give the reactions that you have already studied, which were those of addition to the double bond, for example addition to hydrogen, which changes the behavior to fusion, they can also add oxygen therefore suffer oxidation, and they can add iodine.
the addition of iodine is very interesting as it allows to determine the number of double bonds of fat at the analytical level.
OK...
so we 're going to focus on the goal of the topic that was how the iodine index was determined.
the iodine index measures the saturation of acids degrees and esters, as it is a function of the degree of unsaturation.
it is determined by adding to the sample an excess of halogenated reagent, which reacts with the double bonds, which we have commented of electrophilic addition, and subsequently the excess of halogen that had not reacted will be evaluated by regression.
it is called a redox type of evaluation.
there are two methods: Wijs and Hanus.
we will use, we will study in more depth, that of Hanus.
the result is always expressed as iodine weight absorbed in a hundred parts of dry matter weight.
well, the Hanus method first before describing it say what the reagent consists of.
Hanus reagent is a solution of iodine bromide in glacial acetic acid free of ethanol.
the general procedure to follow consists of the following steps:
dissolve the fat sample with carbon tetrachloride, add the Hanus reagent, let stand for an hour, add potassium iodide and then make the valuation with sodium thiosulfate using starch as an indicator.
look at this reaction as iodine is valued with sodium thiosulfate, and then the presence of iodide is identified with starch.
well, with this we finish this small part of the agenda.
the topic that we are going to discuss today, within the topic of oils and fats, is: saponification index.
the objective of this topic is to know what is the procedure to determine the rate of saponification of different fats and natural oils.
and on the other hand study the reaction on which this determination is based.
it is clear that a basic concept must be revised, which consists of knowing that it is the reaction of hydrolysis or saponification.
the hydrolysis reaction can be done either in alkaline media, or in acid medium.
when made in acid medium, here you have a triglyceride with water in the presence of medium acid, originates fatty acid and glycerin.
whereas, if it is in alkaline medium, it originates a sodium salt of that fatty acid, which is called soaps, and also recovers glycerin.
to describe the soap tell you that a soap molecule is going to have a long hydrocarbon chain and an ionic end.
in the hydrocarbon chain it is hydrophobic, that is, soluble in non-polar substances, while the ionic part corresponds to the part of the salt is hydrophilic, that is, soluble in water.
because of the hydrocarbon chain the soap molecule is not fully soluble in water, however the soap molecules are suspended perfectly in water, and this is due to the formation of this type of structure, which is called micelles, in which the hydrocarbon part is oriented towards where the non-polar part is, the fat, the oil, whatever it is....
the stain we have...
and the ionic part is oriented towards the water.
in addition, these clusters of this part of these micelles repel the other micelles that form.
the capacity then as an emulsifying agent of soap resides in these two properties.
that the hydrocarbon chain dissolves non-polar substances such as fat and oil that are isolated from the medium inside the soap micelles, as we have shown in the previous transparency, and in which the ionic ends of the soap molecules placed on the surface of the micelle attract water and repel the other micelles formed in such a way that the organic dirt is suspended in the water.
with regard to the chemical reaction of saponification, please comment that it is verified in the manufacture of soaps from fats and neutral oils, triglycerides, and is expressed as follows:
saponification, as I have mentioned before, is hydrolysis in the basic medium of these fats or oils.
here the soap is formed, which is the sodium salt of the different fatty acids, and glycerin is recovered as a by-product.
the amount of sodium hydroxide required to saponify a given amount of neutral fat is calculated by what we call fat saponification rate.
so what is the saponification index?
as it is defined as milligrams of potassium hydroxide that are needed to saponify a gram of fat.
we have to attach great importance to the fact that the rate of saponification is a specific data for each fat and natural oil.
when the rate of saponification is high this is telling us that the molecular weight of fatty acids, which contains that fat, is lower, that is, they are short-chain fatty acids.
thus, fats containing short-chain fatty acids will consume more potassium hydroxide to saponify a gram of fat, and thus will have a higher, higher saponification rate.
how are we going to calculate the saponification rate?
the general form is, we start from a known amount of fat, a measured volume is added and in excess of potassium hydroxide in alcoholic solution, and then it is valued with an acid, either hydrochloric or sulfuric.
comment that the saponification index guides on the total proportion of triglycerides contained in the sample, and it is a fact, that together with the iodine index that we have already studied, very important in the analysis of oils and fats.
with this we finish the topic of Oils and fats: saponification index.
today we are going to treat chromatography, the subject of chromatography, more directed towards gas chromatography.
the aim is to introduce the chromatography technique as an analytical method, and also to study gas chromatography and its applications.
to do this we will first make a brief description of chromatography, then we will study the principles of gas-liquid chromatography, we will briefly review which instruments are used, and then also the applications.
okay, in principle...
General Description of Chromatography: well, chromatography is one of the main methods for separating chemical species, which are closely related to each other.
it can be used for qualitative and quantitative identification of separate species.
in general, all chromatographic techniques have at least two phases in common: the stationary phase and the mobile phase.
in the mobile phase it can be either a gas, or a liquid, or a supercritical fluid.
and it also has in common that a sample of components have greater or lesser affinity for each of these phases, either the stationary phase, or the mobile phase.
with regard to the classification of chromatographic methods comment that they can be classified according to the way in which the stationary and mobile phases are put in contact, that is, either a column, or a plane, which is usually called thin plate, and then also the type of mobile and stationary phase and the class of balances involved in the transfer of solutes in the phases, that is, liquid gases and supercritical fluids.
notice this would be like when injecting a sample, either in plate or in column, as it chooses, that is to say this would be the stationary phase where it is retained, and as when we pass the mobile phase each of the molecules are separated according to their affinity between the stationary phase and the mobile phase, that is to say there is a distribution of a component between the mobile and the stationary phase, and therefore a separation of the components.
this would be, these balls that you see here, it would be what is the stationary phase, as we have injected there the sample, and as we are passing the mobile phase they are separating according to the affinity for the mobile phase, that is to say that they choose between a distribution between mobile phase or stationary phase.
those that have more affinity for the mobile phase are moving away and little by little they are separating.
as for the parameters and equations of interest in chromatography in general, highlight within all the parameters that there are, which are quite complicated and that you will see, we have chosen the most characteristic ones that are:
retention time, which is the time it takes each component to reach the detector since it has been injected.
the corrected retention time, which is the comparison between that component retention time and that substance that is not retained, that is, that comes out with the front.
then, volume retention, which is the volume of mobile phase that must be avoided for a certain component to leave the column, and also the resolution, important, which is a parameter that indicates the extent to which two components have been separated avoided consecutively.
as for the fact that it is a chromatogram to tell you that it is, so that you have an idea, this figure that we have put there, then they can be defined as being graphs, which are obtained when a detector is placed at the end of the column that responds to the presence of an analyte, whose representation is usually made depending on the time or depending on the volume of the added mobile phase.
forgive...
I also wanted to tell you about this graph that if you look at it is a chromatogram in which they have been evaluated, here the sample is injected, and here the different mobile phases that are getting involved, that is, the different eluents, are varied.
look, when there is a seventy and thirty percent of water the peaks, or the components, are barely separated, while when we increase the polarity, that is, when we increase the water to sixty percent, we are seeing how these peaks, it is the same sample, that is to say here they come together, it would not be worth us at all, and yet as they are separating.
hence the importance of choosing a good eluent.
with respect to the principles of gas-liquid chromatography, comment that in principle they are the same as for all types of chromatography, either in column or plate, and tell you that the mobile phase is always a gas in this case, which is called carrier gas, that there are two types: solid gas, in which the stationary phase is a solid; liquid gas, in which the stationary phase is a film of liquid of high boiling point, can generally be polyethylene-glycol or silicon coating a solid that is inert.
the compounds that can be separated by gas chromatography, and that you do have to take into account, must always be volatile and thermally stable.
this would be the outline of what would be the interior of the operation of a gas chromatograph.
notice that the sample would be injected here, it would go to what is the column, but to be dragged it needs what is the carrier gas, which normally has been channeled as if they were bottles, and then once it has been injected it passes through the column with that delivery phase that I have commented to you, it is detected as they are separating, and it is recorded.
and once registered, there is a data processing.
so you get the chromatogram that i 've told you about, so you' ve seen it before, and then it gives you the areas of the peaks, retention time, etc.
this would be the outward appearance of a gas chromatograph.
all this keyboard is to put the program that we want both temperature, gas, etc.
you will see this better in the laboratory.
and then tell you some characteristics about the carrier gas, which the main characteristic, as we have mentioned, is that it is chemically inert and is usually used: helium, argon, nitrogen, carbon dioxide and hydrogen.
the choice of carrier gas is usually determined by the type of detector that carries that gas or that we are going to use.
there are many types of detectors, such as flame ionization detector, FID, so-called, thermal conductivity detector, or thermoionic detector and others, depending on the type of sample you want to analyze.
and with regard to the type of columns I would like to tell you that, thank God, this topic has advanced a lot and then the current ones are usually made of glass tube, metal, stainless steel, copper, aluminum or Teflon...
and that the filling of course allows the obtaining of a separation of very diverse components or products.
look at this table that I tell you, you can read it more carefully, as...
and this is what commercial houses give you, they tell you the stuffing the trade name, at what maximum temperature you can place, and then so that they serve, according to what you want to separate recommend one or the other.
and then regarding the applications of gas chromatography comment that it is a tool to perform separations especially, which is very useful in complex organic mixtures, which provides a method or a means to carry out an analysis, since the times and volumes of retention can provide us with a qualitative identification, and then the heights of the peaks and their areas give a quantitative information.
but anyway it is also necessary to comment that inside the techniques especially of identification of compounds is not of the most cutting-edge, if it is not combined with other type of techniques, that you already know.
so today gas chromatographs, or gas chromatography, are usually combined with other instruments such as mass spectrometers, or infrared spectrometers, or nuclear magnetic resonance instruments, which provide us with a more correct or better identification of the compounds present in these natural systems.
in fact through gas chromatography you can identify for example components responsible for the smell and taste of food, water pollutants...
medical diagnoses are also made based on components of breath, and studies on drug metabolites.
or for example, it identifies the composition of essential oils of different aromatic plants perfectly.
OK...
here you have, with this already finished, because the example of a gas chromatogram...
this corresponds to an oil, but to an olive oil.
this is the solvent in which it has been avoided, but all the other peaks correspond to the acids, to the methyl esters, which possess, with which you can know the fatty acids if they have more oleic, palmitic and such, through patterns.
well...
with this I think you have clear information about what chromatography is for and what gas chromatography is.
today we will end with the issue of oils and fats, and we will focus on determining the composition of these oils and fats.
thus, the objective of this small topic is to know the use of gas chromatography for the determination of the fatty acid composition of natural oils and fats.
for this it is necessary to make a small review of the basic concepts.
you all remember that fats and natural oils are complex mixtures of many mixed glycerides, which therefore also contain smaller amounts of other components.
thus, we can say that natural triglycerides are mixed, that is, two or three of their fatty acids are distinct.
as you can see in transparency.
I have given you the example of alpha-palmitil-alpha-beta-dioleylglyceride.
the composition of fats and oils is usually expressed by giving the proportions of fatty acids globally, without distinguishing in which triglyceride they are found.
this is because it is very complex to know where they are placed, in which triglycerides are very similar substances.
for example, there you have the corn oil, the soybean oil, the lard, the butter and the human fat; where you put composition and percentage: palmitic ten percent, stearic five, oleic forty-five and linoleic thirty-eight of the corn oil, and so with the others.
to know the overall composition in the fatty acids of a fat or oil it is necessary to do a hydrolysis or saponification beforehand, to obtain the fatty acids in the form of sodium or potassium salts and to be able to separate them from the non-acid constituents, which are glycerin.
the subsequent acidification of these salts makes it possible to obtain these fatty acids for further analysis.
look, this would be a triglyceride, which put in the presence of methanol and in basic medium we would get the glycerin and methyl esters of each of those fatty acids.
thus, this type of transesterification is carried out, because if we want to analyze them by gas chromatography, as fatty acids have low volatility to be able to analyze them by gas chromatography we must transform them previously into methyl esters.
and this would be the transesterification reaction to turn them into methyl esters of each of those fatty acids that i put in.
the then method of fatty acid analysis consists of two parts:
first the preparation of methyl esters of fatty acids, and then the analysis by gas chromatography of the methyl esters of those fatty acids.
as for the preparation of the methyl esters of fatty acids, comment that the methyl esters as I have mentioned are transformed by the transesterification of vegetable oil with a methanolic solution of potassium hydroxide, as an intermediate phase before saponification occurs.
this is part of a described method, point five of the ISO method that you have there five five zero nine out of two thousand.
then, this method is very fast, it is applicable to both olive oils and olive pomace oils, but always the content of free fatty acids has to be less than three commas three percent, since potassium hydroxide does not produce the esterification of free fatty acids.
to prepare these methyl esters the method is very simple, in a threaded tube a certain amount of oil sample is weighed, heptane is added to dissolve and then a methanolic solution of potassium hydroxide is added.
it closes well, shakes for about thirty seconds, allows to rest and stays as two phases not, then what you have to analyze is the top layer, which is the one that contains the methyl esters.
it is advisable to keep the solution always in the fridge until the time of the analysis, but it cannot be left stored for more than twelve hours.
as you have seen, the transesterification reaction, that is, producing esters from that oil, methyl esters, is a fairly simple process facing analysis.
once this is done, we take the sample of that part that we have commented and proceed to the analysis of by chromatography of gases of those formed methyl esters.
the conditions of chromatographic analysis...
we have put the one we use, but it is a gas chromatograph, the detector we use is FID, the injector, then the type of column is a polar column, which is also suitable for this type of samples, separations.
the stationary phase is polyethylene glycol, the carrier gas is nitrogen, and then this is the conditions of both the temperature of the injector and the temperature of the detector.
comment that the conditions of separation always regardless of whether there are some that are previously established by commercial houses, because there are already many trials, should always be reviewed in the corresponding bibliography.
this would be the temperature program of the furnace that we have used in the gas chromatograph, which begins by injecting a micro liter of samples, it begins at one hundred and fifty with a ramp, that is, it goes up five degrees centigrade per minute and then it stays like that at ten minutes until it reaches two hundred and forty.
with this we obtain this type of chromatogram, which as you will see is a chromatogram of Utiel's extra virgin olive oil and with this we obtain a series of peaks, which in principle we only have its type of retention, which is the number you see here but that compared to patterns punctured in the same conditions we see that we have been able to identify the number one, which is pentadecanoate, then there is palmitate, stearate, oleate, linoleate and linolenate.
look at the retention time, the area, and therefore the concentration, with which we can deduce that in this oil the oleate, that is to say the one that comes from the oleic fatty acid, the oleic, is in a seventy percent with respect to the total content in esters of corresponding fatty acids.
so far we have described a method for determining the fatty acid composition of natural oils and fats, and using gas chromatography.
today's object is entitled Enzymes, within it we are going to study enzymatic browning and referring more to the inactivation of polyphenoloxidases.
the objective of this topic is therefore to study what enzymatic browning is and the different methods to control or prevent browning in fresh fruits or other plant material.
first we will start as always with a review of basic concepts and then focus on what enzymatic browning is and how it can be avoided.
we will start with the revision of the basic concepts, and within it we will see what enzymes are.
you will all remember that enzymes are biological catalysts, they are usually very long proteins, they allow reactions in the conditions tolerated by the organism, they can process millions of molecules every second, and they are very specific, they react with one or with very few types of molecules with which they are called substrates.
enzymes, the way of naming them, the classical way, the name is based on three things: in the substrate on which it acts, that is to say which is the reagent with which it reacts, the reaction that catalyzes, as it reacts, adding at the end of the word asa, the word asa.
for example, lactase enzyme that reacts with lactose.
pyruvate decarboxylase, which eliminates carboxyl from pyruvate.
the systematic nomenclature, that is, the nomenclature followed by the international enzyme commission is a four-digit code number.
the first indicates the basic class in which the enzyme is framed, the second corresponds to the subclass, which identifies the enzyme in more specific terms.
the third exactly defines the type of enzyme activity involved, and the fourth is the serial number of the enzyme within that subclass.
the classification of enzymes based on class type alone would be these six.
among them we would have oxidoreductases, which catalyzes a REDOX reaction, transferases, which catalyze reactions that transfer a functional group, hydrolases, are those that catalyze hydrolysis reactions, liases, which are responsible for breaking carbon-oxygen, carbon-carbon or carbon-nitrogen bonds, isomerases, which are responsible for reorganizing functional groups, and ligases, which join two molecules.
to regulate enzyme activity you know that there are a number of factors involved in that regulation.
temperature, pH, cofactors and coenzymes, as well as the concentration of substrates, influence.
regarding the influence of temperature, you see this graph that is very simple, but the optimal temperature at which they normally act is between twenty-five and forty degrees Celsius.
although it is not necessarily this interval for all enzymes.
and with regard to pH, tell you that each enzyme has an optimal pH in which it has the maximum activity, and above and below that pH there is a series of ranges in which the inactivation is reversible, for example this level, both below and above, and in others in which it is already irreversible and inactivation is instantaneous.
now let 's get into what enzymatic browning is.
enzymatic browning is what causes the phenomenon that you all know, because you have seen it in apples for example when they are split, and enzymatic browning can be defined as what causes darkening in some vegetables rich in phenolic compounds during their preparation or storage.
the phases of its transformation are as follows:
phenols are colorless, they pass through an enzymatic hydroxylation to orthophenols, which are also colorless, from these they pass to form ortoquinones, which are colored, and from here through a non-enzymatic polymerization they form a series of melanoid polymers that are colored, which are those brown colors or strange aromas that are perceived.
polyphenoloxidases act on the first step and on the second until the formation of orthoquinones.
so we say that polyphenoloxidases, this type of enzymes, are metalloenzymes that contain about a zero two per cent comma of copper, and in which molecular oxygen acts as a hydrogen receptor.
its systematic name is orthodiphenol oxygen reductases, and its optimal pH is five with five.
how can polyphenoloxidases be inactivated?
to inhibit enzymatic browning, different treatments can be used depending on the type of product you want to obtain.
there are some that are more suitable, among them it is: the scalding with boiling water, with boiling water or steam, that produces the enzymatic inactivation.
immersion in baths of slightly acidulous water, that is acid, results in the suppression of oxygen from the air.
treatment with ascorbic acid, which reduces the quinones newly formed by phenolases to precursor phenols, and treatment with bisulfite or SO2.
this treatment reacts with polyphenoloxidases and the generated quinones by blocking them and so on.
there are several treatments, we have highlighted four of them.
OK...
all these forms of enzymatic inactivation you are going to be able to test yourselves in the laboratory.
and we have also developed a video as a help that you can consult to see better the results of this inactivation.
with this we are finished.
within the subject of chromatography that we saw the other day today we are going to deal with what is high-resolution liquid chromatography.
the purpose of this part of the topic is therefore to introduce the study of the technique of high-resolution liquid chromatography and also its field of application.
first we will start by doing a brief review of the basic concepts, and then we will also make a small description of what is the high resolution chromatograph and what are its applications.
in principle chromatography within the review of the basic concepts, liquid chromatography, has in common with the rest of the types of chromatography the existence of a mobile phase and also a stationary phase.
in the case of liquid chromatography, the stationary phase is a porous solid, which is supported inside a column usually made of plastic or glass.
and the mobile phase, unlike the gas phase, is a liquid.
here is an example of what would be a column chromatography, in this case an open column.
you see that the glass support would be the filling, and here we would place the sample and put a funnel of decanting with the solvent or mobile phase that we would want to use to avoid our sample and be able to separate it.
look at how as we add the eluent are separating the different components.
the way to separate them now would be to open the key, we could be separating the compound C from the B and A.
in its beginnings this type of chromatography was carried out in glass columns with a diameter of one with five centimeters and approximate lengths of fifty to five hundred centimeters.
and different types of filler were used, usually alumina, silica or magnesium oxide.
with the use of this type of chromatography that we have seen before, it was possible to achieve large increases in the efficiency of the column by decreasing the size of the particle in the filling used.
and currently fillers with a particle size of between three to ten micrometers are being used.
this particle size requires the use of very sophisticated instruments, since the particle size is so small that the flow rate with which the eluent passes to be optimal demands high pressures.
it then requires the use of other types of instruments, and as we have already said, more sophisticated instruments.
the efficiency of the chromatographic separation column in principle, apart from other factors, will depend or is determined both by the size of the filling particle and by the size of the sample that is used.
here on this side of the slide you can see what is currently a chromatograph, an HPLC, a high-resolution liquid chromatograph.
this would be the part of the pumps, which causes the pressure, and also here different types of detectors: photodiode array detector and refractive detector.
on the next slide we will see an outline of what is the high-resolution liquid chromatograph, an HPLC, which has lent us this Hewlett-Packard diagram.
and you can see here how we have different bottles or containers to place the solvents.
there will also be a series of filters to prevent the presence of contaminants in solvents or impurities.
and there is also a valve to mix the solvents, because we have to comment that there are times that chromatography is done only using an eluent, and then it is called isocratic elution, or normally using several solvents or mixtures of both.
and then it is necessary to mix them and we can even manage to vary the proportions of those mixtures.
in that case the elution is said to be with gradient.
here it would be the valve to mix the solvents and would pass to the pump which is what generates the pressure.
it would pass through different filters.
that I'm leaving the cursor.
then until it reached the injection valve, where the sample is injected and with the same pressure would enter the column.
once it is done or is passing the sample through the column it will be recorded, as it comes out, in a detector.
in the following we can see, what I have commented to you today, how it influences to make an isocratic elution or an elution with gradient, that is, how the mobile phase used in the separation influences.
look is the same sample, here it has been done with isocratic elution using methanol-water fifty-fifty.
and yet here it has been done with a gradient elution.
it started with a mixture of forty-sixty methanol-water, and the amount of methanol was increased by approximately eight percent per minute.
note that the resolution is much better in this part, that is, in gradient elution, since it lasts less time and the peaks are much higher and narrower, that is, they are much less widened than in the case of isocratic elution, which apart from the time that the chromatography lasts is much longer.
as for the columns and types of fillers, comment that the columns that are used in the HPLC chromatograph are normally made of stainless steel.
most of them usually have a length of ten to thirty centimeters, and the basic types of filler used are: either film or porous particle.
pelicular, consists of polymer glass balls that are not porous, and spherical coated with a thin porous layer of silica, alumina or a resin ion exchange depending on the type of chromatography we want to perform.
this type of filler, the film filler, is normally used in the precolumns, which are columns that are placed before the analytical column to clean a bit the sample that we then want to analyze, and remove all possible contaminations that may have.
and then, the other type of filling is also very common porous particle, which are formed by porous microparticles with diameters between three and ten micrometers, and are also made of silica, alumina or ion exchange resin, although silica are the most used.
there are two types of detectors and they are based on two properties: either the property of the mobile phase, or the properties of the solute.
among the detectors based on the property of the mobile phase we have: the refractive index detector, electrochemical detectors or light dispersion detectors.
these are the ones that have come out lately, that is, they are more modern.
then, based on the solute property are: ultraviolet absorbance detector, infrared and fluorescence detector.
with regard to the applications presented by this type of chromatography, it is very numerous and the reasons are: its great sensitivity, the facility to adapt to exact quantitative determinations, the suitability that this type of chromatography presents for the separation of non-volatile and also thermolabolic species, and the great applicability that it has to be treated substances that are of interest at an industrial level and also in different fields of science.
for example, you can separate nucleic acids, amino acids, hydrocarbons, carbohydrates, drugs, terpenoids, pesticides, antibiotics, steroids, and even chromatography is used a lot in food quality determinations to see possible contaminations and determine whether or not they meet the quality ranges.
OK...
with this you will be told that you are going to see more carefully what a high resolution chromatograph is, a high resolution liquid chromatograph in a video that we have prepared, seeing all its parts, the types of columns that can be used according to the type of sample that we want to analyze, and you will also see some of the applications seeing the separations as they are made.
that concludes this topic.
my name is María Emilia Casar, I am a professor in the Department of Urbanism at the Polytechnic University of Valencia, and the present object will deal with the domain's information media.
what is domino?
what does it mean?
okay.
we will start from the consideration of dominus domini, owner in Latin, to give the meaning to the domain of property, this consideration is already included in Roman civil law, the basis of our current civil law.
next, we'll look at the goals.
analyze the various means by which property is made public and guaranteed, as well as understand the differences between the registration of the property and the cadastre.
what is a real estate?
the distinction between movable property and immovable property allows us to distinguish that, compared to the former, immovable property is that on things that have a fixed situation and that could not be moved without losing their substance.
okay.
this applies to both an urban estate and a rural estate.
we will continue with the means of information and guarantee of the domain to see that concretely, as such, we find ourselves with the registry of the property and of the cadastre.
what is registration?
the register, for example, here in the city of Valencia, is made up of several sections, specifically fourteen, and it is located between Pintor Peiró streets and also, specifically, Journalist José ombuena.
okay.
specifically, it is a public institution under the Ministry of Justice, and each property registry is managed by a registrar.
who are the registrars?
well, because registrars are public officials for all legal purposes, and each registry has a specific territorial constituency.
in addition, the records are kept by farms, opening of each one of them, a folio registral, and this will be what configure the legal history of the registry.
registration of acts affecting property or property rights in immovable property, whether publicly or privately owned, is the function of the property registry.
certain administrative concessions and assets in the public domain may also be registered.
regarding the principles that inform the registry, or what is the same, the principles of operation of the property registry, we will see the following: first, non-registration.
what does this mean?
the registration of the farms is not mandatory.
now, if it is really advisable, since it guarantees the property.
another of these principles would be the principle of good faith.
principle of good faith, by which the acquirer is kept in that acquisition against third parties, and this once you have written your right, so that you can take this right to your defense to the limit.
okay.
another principle of operation of the property registry is advertising.
the registration of the property is public, everyone can access the information that is collected in it.
on the other hand, there would be the presumption of accuracy.
it is presumed that everything written in the register is true, is accurate, and for this presumption of accuracy to take place, two stages have to be taken.
these phases would consist of what is the drafting of the public document, or what is the same thing, raising the private document to public by notarial protocolization.
on the other hand, when this is almost achieved, registration is ordered by the registrar, and therefore that registration is perfected.
okay.
in short: what is the property registry?
the registration of the property is a public institution that will inform in a public, solemn, reliable way... not only who is the owner of the property, but also the characteristics of it, that is, the surface that it has, what are its borders, the charges or levies that exist on that property, gives us a literal description.
as examples, we have in these transparencies documentation of the registration of the property, which correspond to simple notes, both of what is an urban estate, and of a rustic estate.
the second of the means of information and guarantee of the domain will be the cadastre.
and what is the cadastre?
okay.
in the city of Valencia is located in Roger de Lauria Street, and specifically, the cadastre is an administrative office under the Ministry of Finance, in this case, and in which the real estate, both rustic and urban, with planimetric information, will be described, and this information will serve as a basis for the tax on real estate.
what is the current regulations of the cadastre?
well, the current regulation is configured by the law, which is the Royal Legislative Decree two thousand four, and the regulation of development of this law that would be the Royal Decree of two thousand six.
next we will see, with more accuracy, what is the information provided by the cadastre.
okay.
the information of real estate, including physical, economic, legal characteristics, such as location and cadastral reference, area, the destination use, the type of cultivation or use, the quality of the constructions, also the graphic representation, the cadastral value, and the cadastral holder.
there are two sections that make up the cadastre: the urban section, and the rustic section, each of them depending on the nature of that property.
and here we would also have examples of documentation of that planimetric information provided by the cadastre, both in rural estate and in urban estate, to which we refer.
okay.
we will take the differences between the register and the cadastre according to what has been seen so far.
and, these would be our conclusions.
in principle, the registry is a public institution under the Ministry of Justice, while the registry is an administrative registry under the Ministry of Finance.
on the other hand, the registrant is a registrar, a public official, while the address in the cadastre will be by labor personnel, usually managers.
on the other hand, the descriptive literary information provided by the registry against the planimetric information of the cadastre.
and finally, the register is accurate, it is solemn, it is reliable, it is a guarantee of the purchaser in good faith, and the cadastre constitutes, for its part, the basis of the tax on immovable property.
finally, with regard to the discrepancy between the registry and the cadastre, it can be said that registration always prevails over the cadastre; however, cadastre data can be used as a means of proof to modify a particular registration that does not coincide with the physical reality of a property.
okay.
so far the present object, thank you very much.
my name is María Emilia Casar Furió, I am a professor in the Department of Urbanism of the Polytechnic University of Valencia, and the present object will deal with the review power of the administration.
as antecedents, we start from Montesquieu, concretely his work, The spirit of the laws of mid-eighteenth century, where the theory of the division of powers is established or collected, configuring itself as powers of the state, independent, and presumably impartial, the judiciary, the legislative power, and the executive power.
well, with this consideration we will enter into the objectives to be addressed.
it would be to analyze the revision power of the administration, and to understand the administrative remedies.
what is administration?
within one of the powers of the state, the executive branch, we find the government and the administration.
administration as an extension of that government, and which can be of different kinds, fundamentally marked by the territorial item.
thus, we find the central administration.
central administration whose main exponent are the ministries, the peripheral administration, the peripheral administration consisting of the delegations of that central administration in the various parts of the territory, i.e. government delegations, sub-delegation, etc.
then, institutional administration as another type of administration, and as to the same, is characterized by particular, specific interests...
hence, well, that chamber of commerce, or even, by way of example, professional associations.
we will go down to the regional administration, and specifically, in the Valencian Community, we can cite or relate the Councils.
finally, we find the local administration.
the local administration, which will be made up of deputies at the provincial level, and municipalities at the municipal level.
we now enter into the reviewing power of the administration, and the first thing is to consider what the reviewing power is.
well, public administration is entitled as a subject of law to protect its own legal situations, including its innovative claims to the status quo, thus exempting itself from the common need of other subjects to seek judicial protection.
what do we mean by this?
quite simply, the public administration has the competence to review its own acts.
thus, we come to the conclusion that the power of review of the administration can be, either ex officio, or instance of a party, that is, the administration itself initiates this review procedure, or it is any natural or legal person who requests it, the instance of a party.
with regard to administrative remedies, one has to ask: what is an administrative remedy for?
well, these are legal means that the legal system makes available to individuals to ensure, through the challenge, that the administration rectify its course, that is, the administration here will become a judge and in part, without the need to immediately go to court.
within the classes of resources, the first to consider is the administrative appeal.
what is the appeal brought against?
well, it is brought against acts that do not exhaust the administrative route.
before whom do you stand?
it may be filed either with the superior or with the same organ that issued the act, which, in this case, acts as an intermediary, and shall have ten days for referral to the higher organ.
as to who decides the appeal?
the appeal is decided by that hierarchical superior, and with regard to the requirements for its filing, these are not reasons that the law establishes, that is to say, they are not valued motives, an argument must be obtained with weight, but, however, I say, it is not previously established.
with regard to the time limit for filing the appeal, we would have one month if it is an express act, and three months if the act is presumed, that is, if we are appealing a written decision, or, if necessary, if it is an act that we have had to deduct.
as regards the decision and notification, the time limit shall be three months, and the effects of the non-express decision of the appeal shall be either for the purpose of dismissing the appeal, if it was an express act, or for the purpose of giving reasons, if the appeal was against an alleged act.
the second administrative remedy is the reinstatement appeal.
a remedy of reinstatement, which on the other hand is an optional remedy.
that is to say, either directly, given what is being resorted to, as will be seen, we can go to court, or nevertheless, we can stay in this administrative area.
the first thing is to consider what it stands against.
well, it is brought against acts that put an end to the administrative route, it will be decided by the same body that has dictated the act under appeal.
before whom is he going to stand?
directly, before the body that issued the act, and in this case, there is also no need to resort to assessed reasons.
a legal basis for such an interposition is sufficient, but it is not previously established.
the time limit for bringing an action in this case, in this administrative remedy of reinstatement, will be one month if what we are challenging is an express act, and three months if what is under appeal, on the other hand, is an alleged act.
the deadline for resolving the notification will be one month, and finally, the effects of the express non-resolution, in any case, are negligible.
thirdly, within administrative remedies, special consideration must be given to the extraordinary remedy of review.
extraordinary remedy of review, which as its own word indicates, extraordinary, exceeds or is exorbitant to what is the ordinary administrative route.
in the end, we will deal with an appeal in which we are resorting to it because we have exhausted the ordinary avenue, that is, we cannot file ordinary administrative appeals.
well, in this way we will start against what is brought, it is filed against firm acts in administrative way.
who solves them?
they will be decided by the body that dictated the act, and here there are some reasons established by law.
grounds established by law and which are translated into the following: the error of fact, the appearance of documents of essential value, false documents or testimonies, and such documentary falsehood, or false testimony has been the result of a final sentence in the criminal process, or finally, the extraordinary recourse of review for transgression, bribery, violence, fraudulent machination, or punishable conduct will also take place.
all of them, thus declared, by final judgment.
well, the time limit for filing, in the first case, in the case of the error of fact, would be four years, while in the other cases it would be three months.
we move on to the deadline of resolution and notification, which will take place in three months, and finally, the effects of the express non-resolution will be dismissed.
thus far, the treatment of the review power of administration.
Hello welcome to the innovation 2.0 session.
we are within what is the innovation process, and in this innovation 2.0 session what we are going to see is, those tools that taking advantage of what is the web 2.0 can help us to get the information.
you know that information is the starting point or raw material of the innovation process to generate ideas, then those ideas can filter them and thus become projects.
the objectives that we are going to pursue in this session is basically that you know search engines and repositories where to get information.
how to subscribe to an alert service so that this information reaches us and we will also see a browser that can make it easier for us to search on the Internet.
as for the expectations, what I do want to make clear is that we are not going to leave here being experts in tools 2.0 simply have a global vision of how the web 2.0 can help us in the innovation process.
well, in this web 2.0 always well brings many, many interpretations for me what I would also be interested in is that among you will generate a debate, about what you understand about the web 2.0.
I believe that one of the words that will come out is the ability to interact between users and that the contents that are generated on the web, as we say, are also generated by users themselves.
the concept then of web 2.0, ok, where there are 2.0 people, people who are connected to the internet, innovation that we also say responds to a type of person who has a very entrepreneurial and very proactive attitude.
well, well, the intersection between those two spheres or those two worlds, is what we could call innovation 2.0.
this image that you see so good graphically what I want to represent is that the information on the Internet is so big that it can cause us to have that excess of information, is what we could call infoxication.
OK, so one of the biggest flaws or disadvantages that the information age can have is, say, getting information from the internet, it 's too much information.
it has a lot of advantages, but there's that excess of information, what we're going to try to do is also see how we can minimise that disadvantage.
normally when we start to search, when we have to look for information on the Internet because we resort to the omnipresent Google and there is a gesture that we usually do not do that is to click on, say advanced search.
if we just run that second mouse move to click on what would be advanced search, we see that we have a series of fields, you can see them here, where we filter a lot of the results that we are going to get and that can surely save us some time.
OK, but let's get right into what would be search engines, pardon, search engines and repositories.
repositories is a word that basically means databases where there are more search engines and where we can find more information.
we have as search engines well, we talked before about Google but I would also enter the academic Google.
if you put on the Google scholar or academic search bar, it will take you.
basically, as you also have this powerpoint presentation in your folder, in the course documentation, what you can do is click on those addresses and they take you directly to the search engines.
for example, if we click on scirus, because it takes us to this specific search engine of scientific content, it is the same with others.
okay, i think it 's not worth it, i think when we' re clicking here, we get the direction we can redirect to.
there are other repositories that are institutional as for example we have the CSIC, the Complutense University, the Polytechnic University of Valencia, riunet, vale este.
all of them are accessible from your intranet as students or university staff.
OK, and then we have some good topics like physics or Repec, the thematic repository of economics where we are already going to more concrete issues.
there are other repository collectors such as Recolecta, ok, it is a collector of Spanish documents that is open, we also have the Recercat which is the counterpart of the community of Catalonia.
then we have e-science from the community of Madrid, basically, and the Driver that is going to be or is shaping up as the future European collector.
well, then there are magazines, well, directories of magazines where we can find some interesting articles on the subject we are working on, okay, each one of you because surely you will have some interests, some information needs.
well, we are going to look for those collectors and we are looking for the magazine that may interest us most.
one of the peculiarities of Web 2.0 is that philosophy changes, as well as, almost what we have been seeing so far was, I identify some sources and I go and see how they are varying the information in those sources.
web 2.0 allows us to subscribe to a series of alerts or information that may interest me and when a variation occurs in the source, that is to say that a news story is created that may be of interest to me, I get an alert.
so this is really the potency that innovation 2.0 or web 2.0 can have, that i 'm able to identify which sources are good, what information i' m interested in from each source and then collect that information.
OK.
basically what all the news reader systems are going to allow me is to automate that process, the one that I don't have to be going into every time on the websites to see, let's say, what has happened.
for example, going back to Google because we see that we have a free Google app, which is Google alerts.
OK, so I can create an alert and I define the search parameters, I give you my email and you are automatically sending me all the modifications or all the information that occurs about the topic that I have indicated.
in short, what is involved is to take advantage of all the resources of the web to work for us, and not have us to invest a time that we do not really have to search all the sites.
the term syndication is important, that is, to subscribe to those sources in order to have the information.
let's say what it allows us is that an article that has been published in some website, in some blog, in some web page of our interest, because it comes to me and I can read it calmly when I have the time.
it is important to know the concept of subscription in an analogue world, well we see here I subscribed to a magazine, this magazine they sent it to my house, it came to me because periodically, if it was monthly, monthly, bimonthly, or maybe I was going to the library to consult it physically.
however, in the digital world it is in the world in which we are now, because I subscribe to a website and what I get are the contents, of interest of that website, which greatly simplifies the process.
where to find the feeds to be able to subscribe, for example in the Higher Polytechnic School of Gandía we can find it with the RSS symbol on the website.
we can also, if we know directly the URL in the corresponding reader we enter that URL.
in browsers such as firefox directly displays that symbol and by clicking on this symbol, following a few simple steps I subscribe.
in short it is relatively, it is intuitive and easy to subscribe to these feeds, the interesting thing is to find or decide which are the sources that really provide me with information.
okay, because we have a lot of information on the internet as we mentioned earlier.
well, as for feed readers, well the concept is that I detect a website that may be of my interest, I subscribe and then I get to the RSS reader, to the feed reader, where what I do is receive that article.
again Google Reader, has a free application where I can also very intuitively subscribe to all these sources or websites that provide me with information of interest.
another interesting concept is the homepage.
the homepage is a web service that can act as a virtual desktop when connecting us to our computer and being connected to the Internet.
it is a very interesting service and sometimes we use the homepage simply blank other times we put Google as omnipresent, some because they also use the corporate website for example from the Polytechnic University or the company where you work.
others use some pages as I do not know, because the newspaper that is more favorite.
however, I believe that you can get more out of it by using a personalized home page of each one, because we will use it as the main base of operations.
where we say I see the emails that come to me or I can include some mail services, that I have my email accounts.
I see the feeds or RSS feeds to which I have subscribed, if I want at the beginning if you want you can subscribe to the time, but good or some service of photos or of videos or multimedia, but each one of you has to see which service is the one that is most interested in subscribing.
I'm going to give you two, two examples that may be interesting to subscribe to, netvibes.com and iGoogle, ok.
Google also has another free service where I can generate my homepage I put some widgets or gadgets or say small applications.
that what I do is because what we have commented before, hears as I subscribe to a certain newspaper and I see its news, I subscribe to a certain library or repository and I go seeing its alerts.
I see perhaps several emails or the electronic agenda, in short is to enter what I propose now the end of this session more conceptual is that you enter all these tools and you go testing.
finally, to finish in what we had left of the contents of these tools 2.0 is to talk about browsers.
well, we know that the omnipresent is the internet explorer, but you know, the firefox, the firefox mozilla is winning over him, he 's gaining ground.
I particularly use firefox, I also use Google Chrome, this one because for some Google apps are interesting.
and well then the internet explorer also because there are some services, which can be better visualized with internet explorer.
each one of you who does what seems most comfortable, I will propose some advantages that can have the use of firefox for all these issues of technological surveillance.
well we can download them free of charge from the mozilla website, where we have that free download, here you have the website as I tell you in the course information you already have the corresponding powerpoint with which you can directly enter the mozilla website and download it to you.
what advantages can I see for the firefox?
the one that can be customized, that has a community of both developers and users and you can share some doubts, solve some issues that are raised to you, is free software therefore maybe we do not depend on some multinationals and has some extensions or complements that are very interesting.
I put you here Zotero, it is a mini application or a complement that we can install in the firefox to say manage our bibliography that we handle on the Internet or say a historical of what we are doing.
when it comes to presenting some work, it may be interesting, but in other practical sessions we will talk more about these extensions or complements of firefox.
well, finally, i wanted to make reference to the fact that this presentation has the creative commons license, which means that you can, you can share it, all over the world.
thanks to Daniel Robles who is a researcher at the Polytechnic University of Valencia who attended a course on tools 2.0, I learned a lot from him, and some of the things I learned because I have tried to transmit them and good because I have also used their transparencies and wanted to thank Daniel Robles, this collaboration.
and nothing so say goodbye to you simply here you have a transparency where there are a lot of web 2.0 services, and the truth is that living in this twenty-first century makes things much easier, if one so good, because it understands in what paradigms and how to move with web 2.0 and take advantage of it for innovation.
thank you very much.
Hello welcome, my name is Jordi Maurí, and today we are going to talk about the value curve.
the value curve is a very interesting tool that can help us to configure what our value proposition would be when we are working with innovative projects.
okay.
the objectives that we are pursuing here, let us say in this sitting, is that we understand how we can build or develop a value curve that on the one hand analyses the proposal that our competitors are making and on the other hand helps us to reflect on the proposal that we can bring to the market.
the content of this session is basically going to be to see what the value curve consists of.
visualize an example, and from there you can already apply it to your say to your topic of work that we have entrusted, each of the teams that has entrusted in the course.
well, if you look at transparency we can see that we need two axes to make the value curve, in the horizontal axis what we are going to define here are going to be the attributes of my product or my service.
OK, so in the example we'll see some attributes and that can help us identify how we can complete this horizontal axis.
and on the vertical axis, what we 're going to see is the level offered, ok, if it' s a low level, it 's going to be in this area, and if it' s a high level around here.
obviously we can establish other types of scales, maybe dividing it from one to seven, okay, but always taking into account that the lowest level, we start and go to the highest level.
as I mentioned we will see an example, and the example is the circus du soleil, the circus of the sun.
it is a company that was created in the eighties, just when the circus sector was a declining sector.
well, of course you still wonder and who can think of setting up a business, in a sector that is lost or in decline, or that people are not grateful or are not going to that service, using that service.
well, i think the sun circus, the founder of the sun circus used this tool to really propose something innovative.
the attributes from my point of view studied the creator of the circus of the sun were therefore as for the traditional circus, the price they have, the stars, the stars that are say, the performances intervene.
I don't know, if we were talking about Spain then maybe we could talk about Barbara Rey, or Miliki, to go to another segment.
then also another of the attributes that the circus had was the show with animals, no, the subject of the fiercest tigers in Africa and such, other things were concessions.
what are concessions?
well you're there in the circus and they go and sell you popcorn, sandwiches, soft drinks.
and another attribute could speak of multiple clues.
I remember when I was a kid we were going to the circus, and there was a central track, no, where there were some shows, and then there was one on the smaller side where there were some clowns games, something smaller, they had multiple tracks.
another attribute was fun and humor, this humor that you remember about clowns when they threw the meringue cakes were put zancadillas or they were given some blow.
it was a humour that made me laugh, no.
suspense and danger, of course I do not know if some of those who went to the circus because they were there pending to see if the trapeze player fell or if the lion closed his jaw when the tamer had his head inside his mouth, used with this not, with this danger.
and another of the things that he observed, but in this case that didn 't exist was the common thread, ok.
the guiding thread, this creator of the sun circus realized that it did not exist in the traditional circus, but that they gave us a battery of shows more or less with a chronology in the time but with nothing that connected them, and it began and ended.
with which the common thread did not exist.
so, well, we 're going to analyze, for example, a value curve, based on these attributes, of a circus that could be a pioneer or a leader in the eighties, ok.
it had such a price, because we put it at this level, maybe we could say because it hears twenty euros.
OK, so the stars were based on using, on bringing in stars that had renown, shows with animals, yes, it offered it at a very high level, because it brought in the fiercest lions of the African savannah, the deadliest bear in Russia, anyway it brought in the fiercest and most striking animals.
concessions, because yes, they even understood that maybe almost more money selling popcorn and coca-cola or fanta, than another type of activity.
multiple tracks, yes, as I mentioned before because yes, they used to have several tracks to have some performances.
even there the creator of the sun circus realized that having several tracks provided us or distracted us more than helped us.
as for the fun and humor, yes, clowns hitting, falling, batacazos and porrazos, and getting dirty with meringue cakes.
suspense and danger a lot, a lot of danger, even they were called the mortal jumps, triple mortal jump, double mortal jump, they generated that expectation of danger.
and the common thread, as we have said, no, it did not exist, there was no common thread.
well then, if I plan for example to enter a sector, and what I do is a conventional analysis of competition, and I conclude that I can not offer as much as they, because I am not so great because I have just started, because maybe I fall into the temptation to generate a value curve, of less value, worth redundancy.
and what I do is, well then the stars, because man I am not going to take the last stars that have more fame at the moment, but I take those that are already a little pasaditas, in the animals because I do not bring the fiercest.
in the concessions, you know, I don't have so much capacity to sell other things, multiple tracks, because I still have a few less, the danger and suspense and what is humour, because I also discount it a little because I'm always working with secondary actors.
and the common thread, because I don't do anything either, so, the conclusion that it is, the price is worth if we see it here totally to the left of transparency, the price that I can ask for the service that I offer, is going to be naturally lower.
now, what did this gentleman, the founder of the sun circus, do?
the founder of the sun circus analyzed this value curve and proposed a totally different value curve, ok.
come on, it's the one we have drawn in blue.
then we will take care of the price, but for example this person said, hey the stars I'm going to eliminate them, I'm going to eliminate all the stars because it also generates a problem for me and that is that I can not have simultaneous representations, because if for example Barbara Rey comes to Valencia, then she can not be in Barcelona or Madrid because today she is in Valencia.
eliminating the stars maybe I can win, in that flexibility of representation and also reduce costs.
show with animals, gosh, realized that just animal abuse was not rife in society, is more, was rejected by society.
so if I offered a service that could be interpreted as mistreating animals, maybe it was negative, I completely eliminate it.
the concessions, yes I eliminate the concessions during the show but then they sell you based merchandising both before and after, a lot.
multiple tracks, nothing I delete them, I just leave a clue because I want people to focus on the show that's happening.
fun and humour, obviously we are talking about circus I have to offer fun and humour but a more refined humor, what I do is if you realize it, I discount, okay.
it lowers the level offered by traditional circuses and brings it down to a more refined mood.
I also do with suspense and danger, I don't call them mortal jumps anymore, but, well, people see there that they are athletes who can really injure themselves, but it's as if they are practicing a sport; it's not something that I'm going to look for there that they injure themselves, but I'm looking for a show, I reduce that danger.
the thread, practically did not exist or there was very little, what I do is to turn it into the main axis of my value proposition.
I generate a thread that leads me to generate a theme and to provide a refined environment, ok, and it is as if we were talking about a mixture between what is the theater, the cinema, a film, a musical and the circus.
which brings me to pardon, here i 've jumped off the slide.
it leads me to think that I can make multiple productions like in the cinema, okay.
I can make the premiere of a film in Madrid, in Valencia, in Barcelona, in Paris, in Frankfurt, in Berlin, in a lot of cities, in fact I think they have twenty-seven or thirty simultaneous productions all over the planet.
so they are getting a concept that is economy of scale in a sector that seemed impossible to get it that was the circus, because it was impossible to reproduce a circus from one place to another.
this value curve is worth it, the blue we are following now, I said, we have commented that we would talk at the end of the price.
the price really, they can charge you ninety euros which is three times more than what they charge you in a traditional circus, and the customer does not complain because they can always tell you to hear but if it is different, this circus has nothing to do with the circus of value.
with the traditional circus, sorry.
this is a circus that really brings a differential value that they are basically, I eliminate what was problematic area, what we see down here and I introduce things or attributes that I didn't have.
what I propose to you is that you reflect on your business model, your work, your project that you have in mind.
and let you see and analyze what is happening in the competition, what attributes that are being offered by the mass of the competition can be eliminated because they don't really like, they don't buy, which ones can be reduced because in reality they are not providing value, and they are being offered in a way that is, say, oversized.
which ones I can increase, those attributes that don't really meet the customer's need, and which others I can create again.
so basically, the summary of the session would be to have a methodology to be able to analyze the value proposition of my competitors, based on that value curve, once we have identified the attributes and the level at which my competitors offer it, see what I can eliminate, reduce, increase or create and from there build my value proposition.
thank you very much for attending this session and I invite you to work on your proposals.
Hello welcome, my name is Jordi Maurí and today we will talk about how to generate and manage the ideas that we can come up with for the innovation process.
we remember that we are seeing tools in this series of sessions that we have raised in the course, which help us to manage what is the innovation process, a very important one is the generation of ideas.
to do this, let's see what the innovation process is, let's review it.
okay, from what it 's like to generate ideas, to how we select those ideas, we generate a project specification, and then here we' re already managing the projects, ok.
to manage the projects you have to plan them, execute them and then close them with a report so that knowledge management remains.
specifically today's session is going to focus on one of the tools to generate ideas, ok, and the basic objective of this session is that we understand the concrete methodology of the scamper method.
which is a checklist, or the English and the Americans call it a checklist, what it does is stimulate the generation of ideas, ok.
based on some action verbs, okay, that will be the goal, let's understand the methodology of how to work with this tool.
as we have said it is a checklist and what I do is ask myself a series of questions, which are the questions begin with the letters by which the acronym scamper is formed.
then the first the S replace.
Hey, what can I replace with my product or service?
C refers to combining.
so how can I combine different solutions or different parts of my product to generate something different.
how I can adapt it would be A.
what can I adapt, either to my product from outside or that my product adapts to some circumstance or some market opportunity I see.
what can I magnify with the M make bigger, or also modify, that's why in this letter we get two questions, we can get two questions.
what I can do bigger, magnify, or what I can modify.
the P is put other uses in English, is to put other uses or give it or use it of another, say with another use, is a little this P is the only one that would squeak a little in the Spanish vocabulary, okay, because as I said it is a technique developed in, say in what is the Anglo-Saxon culture.
but well, the P is thinking about putting it to another use, to give it another use.
the E of eliminating, okay, what can I eliminate, which we say is not providing value and even hinders the marketing of this product or this service or the carrying out of some process within my company, which I can eliminate.
and finally the R that i can reorder, ok, or reorder or say reverse change the perspective from which i 'm looking at the manufacturing process, the product that i' m manufacturing or selling, the service.
and this would be let 's say the list of questions is ok, scamper what we have to be very clear about to practice the scamper tool is to identify what is the element that i' m going to improve, ok, what i 'm going to introduce, an innovation, whether it' s product, service or process.
and then follow that scamper list of questions about that problem, that challenge you're addressing.
let's see an example, a brief example, imagine that we are a manufacturer of clips, and that we have the traditional clip you see here to the right of the slide.
and I start to wonder what I can replace in the clip, how I can combine the clip to make it different, what I can adapt to the clip, how I can modify the clip, what I can magnify or what I can add to the clip, what other uses I can give to this clip, what I can remove from the clip and finally that rearrangement or that rethought of what the clip would be might be better.
let's see the result that gave this manufacturer and replaced, you remember the question of replacing, replaced metal with plastic.
surely for this reason that sometimes leave metal clips, when they have already been archived for a year the documents or a little more leave as a kind of rust, just replaced them with plastic, added color, because clear before all metal.
he hears then to add color to the life because also this very well, but that maybe it produced him the one that realized that adding him color they could mean forgiveness they could classify because those colors could mean certain things, then for example I have a project and to each phase of the project I assign a color, and I frame it with the clips.
with which he already gave another use to the clips.
and even other forms and such, in short we are not going to extend much, but I have wanted to transmit this example to you so that you see the power that this method can have.
obviously they didn't in the two minutes, I guess they would spend a lot of time coming up with such a creative solution like this.
well, let's see other examples, so that you understand the concept of the list of questions no?
what can I replace?
well, saccharin replaces sugar, hybrid engine technology is replacing conventional engines.
what things can I combine?
man Ferrero came up with combining what was chocolate that was one of his, it is one of his great competitions to make chocolates with playing with children, and I create the surprise Kinder.
OK, I combine chocolate with play and create a new product.
adapt, well, we know the post-it, no, before the people either based on chinchetas or base of jealousy, of adhesive tape, was sticking the notes, well because here they introduced a sticker, and they adapted to serve to put those notes.
how can I magnify or modify make bigger?
well, normal pliers, because to make them bigger with another new shape so that they can be used for clamping or holding, say, larger pipes or more complex sets of pipes, I can give you other uses.
here in the transparency you see on the left side that would be say the paraffin or the traditional wax of the candles, that good because they were used basically the candles were used a little to illuminate not.
illuminate and clear as the whole issue of electric light grows and so I imagine that they should have been running out of business or just the business of processions and such.
there is a manufacturer who uses candles or candles as decorative motifs, gives them shapes, gives them colors, gives them aromas and that is to give it another use.
hear this candle not only serves to make light, it serves to decorate your home, your office, your workplace.
OK, then delete or minimize.
well, the traditional concept of the gym is a concept where they had weights that had inertia, which had a series of elements that could injure the person who is practicing sport.
however, well, this company has taken out a machine that eliminates all those inertia but if it has the necessary resistance to build muscle, okay.
we have eliminated all those weights and all those mobile inertia that ultimately hindered the practice of the sport and could even injure us.
good to reorder or invest, that is the concept of Hewlett Packard when it manufactures the printers turns out that it renounces to make money, to earn profits with the sale of printers, it wants to make money with the sale of consumables, which was unthinkable until that time, right?
you say, Hey, but if you make printers, how can you not make money from printers?
not because the business is in consumables.
then this he sees, Nespreso that I imagine that the ones, in this case those that you have seen the announcement of George Clooney because you will know that I am referring.
well, of course Nespreso sells you the coffee maker and then what he charges you is considerable money where he makes the profits where he makes the profits for the consumables, for the small doses of coffee.
well, at this point I wanted to present to you what the scamper tool is basically is to follow those questions to ask ourselves how we can change but as a summary the first thing is to be clear what is the product or service, or process that we want to address is the challenge.
then let's apply in the second instance, apply the verbs from the checklist to see how we can come up with changes, modifications, let's say other optics another way to see that challenge.
above all we make sure to ask each and every one of the questions because there may be one that says no, this is not applicable to my business or my product or my service no, let's all make sure that something will come out.
and then, let's review all the possible changes and see if they fit the criteria that we have as we say strategic approach of the company or that solution that we are looking for.
well, thank you very much, I hope you will enjoy this technique to apply it in your real life, in your professional life, in your personal life, thank you very much.
Hello welcome, my name is Jordi Maurí and today we are going to talk about the innovation process.
the aim of the session is for you to have a global vision of the processes or sub-processes involved in the innovation process.
we've been seeing that innovation can be bringing out a new product through some incremental innovation, or it can also be that that product is so new that innovation is totally radical.
just as we speak for processes we speak for services, or even to rethink our business model.
well, today we are going to see it, it is the systematic process of innovation that can be applied to any type of innovation, and in any industry, company, organization.
basically we are going to draw now what would be the first important process within what would be the innovation process.
this process is about generating ideas, you know, how we generate ideas.
I 've drawn it a little bit like that, but you can do a little bit better, but what i' m interested in is that we understand that ideas are the material, the raw material of the innovation process.
once we have generated those ideas we will proceed to select them, well, selection of ideas.
selection of ideas.
for the selection of ideas what we will establish will be a series of criteria, both of economic viability and of technical viability that allow us to decide which of those, or which of those ideas can pass to the phase of projects.
OK, project phase.
that would already be the last great process of what are the innovative process.
in the projects what we have achieved has been to have that screen, that filter of ideas, we have had some project specifications and we are going to manage those projects by means of a good planning, an execution, a monitoring, a control of what is being executed.
and then a closing process so that there is a constancy within the organization, a knowledge management and that all the knowledge, all the learning that has been developed in the projects can be used.
basic, in what is the generation of ideas, we have technological surveillance.
OK, technological surveillance doesn 't just mean it' s seeing what 's going on in technology, that we also have to look at it, we have to see what' s going on in competitors, what 's going on with market trends, what' s going on in the social economic environment.
thus, technological surveillance has several aspects and is one of the sources of what would be the process of generating ideas.
on the other hand we have another important component that is creativity, okay, we can promote creativity internally within the company there are different tools, for example scamper is a tool.
morphological analysis brainstorming, in short there are many tools that we can empower within the company that will help us to create new ideas and new concepts, and this is also linked to the processes of technological monitoring of analysis of the environment that we have commented.
therefore for what would be already summary or some conclusions of what would be the process innovation we see that we have a very important part that is the generation of ideas, generation of concepts where we rely on technological surveillance and creativity.
then, once we have these ideas we go on to define selection criteria that allow us to identify what those opportunities will be, those ideas that will really give us better profitability to the company or that we say its viability analysis is more favorable to us.
and once we have that selection made we will have a portfolio of projects to which we will already be able to allocate resources for its implementation, ok.
and this ultimately the global framework of what would be the innovation process or implement an innovation management system would go through these three pardon these three processes, which can then be broken down into procedures adapted to each of the needs of the different organizations in which they want to implement.
well, thank you very much for attending this virtual session on the explanation of what the process of innovation in organizations can be, thank you very much.
Hello welcome to the opportunity scenario session, within what is the innovation process we will see a concept that from my point of view is key to be able to detect opportunities or ideas that lead us to generate new business models, new products, new services.
we have called it an opportunity scenario because basically what we are going to try to define in this session is the framework and the factors and the actors that can define that opportunity.
normally, innovation has always been taken into account what would be the technological variable, good we have always thought or companies have traditionally thought that to carry out innovation because they had to have a very strong technological base, which is true but it is not enough.
not only do innovations have to do with technology, they sometimes rely on technology, but other times they have to do with the economy and the market.
okay, I put marketing MKTG not to see how the market is distributed as the market is segmented, how I can launch the product, sorry, to the market a product that is affordable for the market and buy it from me.
and not only those two spheres, or those two optics are necessary, but there 's a third one that has to do with the social, ok.
with the social, with the emotional, with what we are saying today really worrying society and how they are evolving, then the scenario of opportunity is the intersection of those three spheres is worth, which would be as we say, would have a form such that so.
like a triangle where there would be some pieces, that then we will work more let's say in detail.
OK, so basically the scenario of opportunity is going to be defined by the intersection of three spheres or three ways of looking at the market, that is, the technological sphere, the social sphere, society and the marquetinian and economic sphere.
well, if we go forward sorry.
we 're going to go back, because in this case, we' re going to do now what would be a zoom in to that opportunity scenario that we 've said was the intersection of the three spheres, ok.
it was like a puzzle, where we have four pieces that the actors have, the actors are the customers, both current and future customers, even those customers or those actors who seem to be not going to be our customers now immediately but who in the future may become so.
these actors have needs, those needs can be hidden, they can be more visible, there are even some that can be unspeakable, we have to have the ability to discover those needs.
and what we are going to do is provide solutions to those needs that our actors have, but especially in the context of use.
in the context.
for example now surely given how society is evolving towards all digital issues, all the issues of the information society is a very big opportunity to offer solutions in that context of the digital economy, of digital people.
therefore and to sum up let us remember what that opportunity scenario would be.
that opportunity scenario is the intersection of seeing the market from three points of view, the technological point of view, I have to consider all available technologies, which can help my product, at my service.
even those who can, can hurt you, to keep them in mind, those who can replace my product.
I have to keep in mind that I am going to have to launch that product or that service to a market that has to buy it from me and therefore I am going to have to get an interesting price, I am going to have to play with marketing techniques that surely will not be the traditional ones.
and above all I have to see the social part, the emotional part.
well, at that intersection is where the opportunity scenario occurs, which is that four-piece puzzle, there are some actors, who have some needs.
I am able to solve these needs but above all in a context of use, the context of use is very important.
well nothing, thank you very much and until next time.
Hello, my name is Germán Moltó, I am a professor in the department of computer systems and computing, and in this learning object we are going to talk about one of the most efficient data structures oriented to the search of comparable data, the binary search tree.
once finished this learning object is intended to be able to: know the structure of the binary search tree and its main characteristics.
recognize ABB as one of the most powerful search-oriented data structures.
understand what are the main operations that an ABB supports and how their cost varies depending on the level of balance.
and without further delay we will begin.
the binary search tree is a structure of data that allows to represent them in a way that they are ordered according to a certain criterion.
with what objective?
in order to allow the search of elements in times below the linear, that is, much faster than if we were looking in a traditional vector.
a binary search tree is a binary tree that includes the following order property, all data from its left subtree is less than or equal to the one that occupies its root, all of its right subtree are larger, and in turn the left and right subtrees are also binary search trees, let's see an example.
here we see an example of a binary search tree, it is a tree because it is a set of nodes connected by edges, it is binary because each of the nodes only has at most two children and it can be observed that for each of the nodes, all of the left subtree are smaller or equal to it, and all of its right subtree are stricter than it.
and of course each of its subtrees also meet the ABB's ordination property.
it is important to note that the way of building ABB mainly affects the cost of operations and is that it is not the same to build a full tree, that in which all levels are complete, that a completely degenerated tree, that on each level there is only one node.
because while the former can be shown to have a height that is of the order, of the logarithm in base two with the number of elements, for the degenerate tree we have a height that is linear with the number of elements, that is, many higher.
and then we'll see, the main cost of operations is related to tree height.
and this height also affects the way in which the tree has been built.
for this we will see an example, imagine that we want to insert these numbers in an ABB.
if we insert them using an ascending sequence as we have here, the three would be the root element of the ABB, then we insert the four, and for that to be an ABB it must go into the right subtree of node three.
then we insert the five, and so on.
note that when performing an orderly insertion of the elements at the end what we get is a degenerated tree.
on the contrary, if we take as the root element the median, that is to say that value which has half of elements less than it and half of elements greater than it, the construction of the tree gives us a balanced scheme, well.
let us now focus on the main operations on an ABB.
the search is quite intuitive because when I want to search for an element, I always compare it with the root of the subtree that I am processing and if it is less than or equal to the root the search continues through the left subtree, and on the contrary if it is greater the search continues through the right subtree.
let's see for it an example, and note that if we wanted to look for element three we would start with the root of the tree, as the three is smaller than the five.
I search for the left subtree, and would compare with the two, as the three is greater than the two I search for its right subtree and here as I have already found the three, directly finishes the search.
well and the question is, there are significant distances, when you calculate the temporal complexity of the search in a binary tree, there is a better case and there is a worse case, so clearly.
the best case is when the element I am looking for is at the root of the tree, in that case with a single comparison, with a constant cost to calculate it and the worst case is when the element is either not in the tree or is in any leaf of the highest level.
in this case note that a number of comparisons are made proportional to the number of levels, that is the height of the tree.
well, therefore in the best of cases constant, but in the worst of cases the temporal complexity is proportional to the height of the tree, but remember that the height of the tree moves between logarithmic with the number of elements, and linear with the number of elements.
therefore, if the tree is balanced look in the worst case has a logarithmic cost and if the tree is degenerated, look in the worst case has a linear cost with the number of elements, therefore it is critical the way in which we build the ABB.
well let's focus now on the insertion operation in an ABB.
to insert the element, first we have to look, what is the position where it should be inserted and then, solve the insertion, note for example that if we want to insert the element ten as it is greater than seven, it should be inserted in this subtree, since it is greater than nine it should be inserted in the right subtree.
well and with this we solve the insertion.
note that the cost of the insertion operation as it involves a search, in the end the cost is identical to that of searching in a binary tree.
well, getting the minimum and maximum of an ABB, that's relatively simple, because taking advantage of the ABB's sorting property I know the minimum element is in the branch as far to the left of the tree as possible, because if there was a smaller element than it would be to your left, fine.
and the maximum element is in the branch as far to the right as possible of the tree so it is relatively easy to get these two values.
well we focus now apart from removing an element from the binary search tree, this operation is a little more complicated because it has three different cases.
in the first case is when I want to delete a data that is on a sheet, that is, a node that has no children.
then we simply have to remove the node.
in this case I would like to delete the data that is in node one, as it is a sheet, that is, it has no children, I directly delete the data, and what we have left is still a binary search tree.
well that's case one, case two, is to try to delete a node that only has one child.
in that case the actions to be performed is summing up that the grandfather has to adopt the grandson, notice, if I want to erase the data five, five is a node that has only one child, in that case the two that is the grandson of the three adopts the son.
OK, and we removed this node which is the one i wanted to delete.
notice again that the result is still an ABB.
and finally when I want to delete a data in a node that has two children, I have to follow the next protocol, I have to replace the data of the node to be deleted, by that of its successor and then delete this last node.
but of course, how is the successor to a data calculated?
well the successor is the lesser element of all those who are greater than him, that is, if he placed them in their orderly position, in an orderly row would be the next element.
for this particular case the successor of a node is the minimum of the right subtree, notice all those who are older, those who are in the right subtree, the smallest of them, the one who is as far to the left as possible.
for example the successor of the seven, is the minimum of its right subtree, is the nine, and the successor of the two, is the minimum of its right subtree, that is the three, which is as far to the left as possible.
let's see an example, if I want to erase the two data, notice that since you have two children, what I have to do is calculate the successor of the two, which is the three place in this node, notice and directly remove the node where the successor was the three.
it can be observed that the result still complies with the ABB management property, therefore a golden rule is that none of the operations that modify the tree structure should affect the tree management property.
well here is a comparative table of the asymptotic temporal complexity of the binary search tree versus other traditional structures.
where you can see that when the tree is balanced, its average cost of operations are logarithmic as the number of elements, but you have to be careful because if the tree is degenerated its cost, it can become linear.
well as conclusions, what I would like to highlight is that the binary search tree is a powerful data structure oriented to the search of comparable data.
it allows to perform the main operations in logarithmic cost with the number of elements, this is much faster than if I work with an array in general.
but you have to be careful, the tree must be balanced, because if we are not going to linear costs.
and of course to have the tree balanced, the choice of root is fundamental.
we have already seen that if we choose as the median element, that is as the root element of each subtree, the median with that we will end up building a tree that is balanced.
well and for my part that is all, I hope it has been useful to you, thank you very much.
Hello, my name is Germán Moltó, I am a professor in the department of computer systems and computing, and in this object of learning I will talk about one of the most used data structures, in applications that use the priority queue model, the binary mound.
well, once the learning object is finished, it is intended that you will be able to justify the need of the binary mound for certain applications, know what are the main properties of the binary mound, understand what are its main operations and what is its asymptotic temporal cost.
and without further delay we will begin.
binary mound is a data structure that among other things allows to obtain the minimum element of a set in constant time, that is, regardless of the size of the set.
this is important in applications that use the priority queue model, in which the elements must be obtained based on a certain priority, for example a queue of priority of patients in a hospital, in which the most urgent patient must be cared for.
or a priority queue of printing jobs where it is necessary to print the shortest jobs as soon as possible.
well a binary mound, also called a heap, has two properties.
a structural property and a property of order, let's focus now on the structural property.
a heap is a complete binary tree, that means all levels are full except perhaps the last one, but in that case all nodes are as far to the left as possible.
the fact that it is a complete tree guarantees that its height is bounded by the logarithm in base two of the number of elements, therefore it gives us a height higher than the heap height.
and the order property is very simple, what it tells us is that for each node, their children are always older or equal than the father, and in addition each of those subtrees fulfills the property of ordering heap.
well therefore it has structural property and order property, this definition we have given is that of minimal binary mound, where the children are always greater or equal than the father.
therefore, by definition the minimum element will be located at the root of the binary mound.
well here we have an example of binary mound, you can see that it is a complete tree and precisely the complete binary trees have the characteristic that they can be represented implicitly using an array.
to do this only by doing a tour of levels of the binary mound, which are the nodes that are labeled by numbers, doing that tour by levels and placing them in an array we can capture all the information of the binary mound.
and get parent-child relationships using simple mathematical expressions.
for example, the left child of the node in position I is in position two by I plus one in the array, for example.
the left node, of the sixteen that is in position two of the array is in position two by two plus one five, that is, in position five, note how the nineteen is the left son of sixteen.
we also have mathematical expression for calculating the right son, and also for calculating the father of a node, for example, the father of node thirty-one which is in position four, his father is in position four minus one three divided by two, as is whole division one.
the father of thirty-one is twenty-one.
therefore note that with these simple mathematical expressions and with an implicit representation in an array it is very fast to access the elements of a binary mound.
well let's focus now on the main operations on a binary mound.
the insertion operation must guarantee that it does not violate any of the properties of the mound, that is, neither the structural property nor the order property.
for this, to fulfill the structural property what we will do is place the element in the first free position of the vector and to satisfy the property of order, what we have to do is to reposition that element over its predecessors until the property of order on the mound is satisfied.
let's look at an example.
imagine that on this mound we want to insert element fourteen.
to fulfill the structural property should insert it here in the first free place that we have but of course, if I insert here the fourteen this no longer meets the property of heap because this element should be greater or equal to the thirty-one, therefore this is where the element should go, we call it as hollow, well.
and we have to compare this gap with respect to the father.
so if this element is less than the parent we exchange them.
notice the father is thirty-one, as here I have fourteen what I do is exchange, this is where I will have the gap and thirty-one goes down.
and I continue this process, now I compare this element, this gap with respect to the father, here would go the fourteenth as it is smaller than the twenty-one I have to exchange them.
here would be the hole, here would be the fourteenth, well and here is the twenty-one below.
notice that this process continues and now I compare again with respect to the father and since the fourteen is already greater than the thirteen, already found which is its proper position, and notice that the result what we have left, this fulfills both the structural property and the property of order.
well, this is the process of re-patching an element.
well, what is the time complexity of this method, there are significant distances, there is better case there is worse case, well yes, clearly yes.
the best case is that the new data that I will add, is greater than the data of its parent node and then in that case, I do not have to remodel the element with a constant cost, directly I already have it located.
and note that the worst case is that I add a new data that is the minimum element of the set, in that case I have to reboot that element throughout the ascending branch to the root.
in that case I travel a distance that is proportional to the height of the tree but as I know that the height of the tree is logarithm on the basis of two of the number of elements, because it is a complete binary tree, that is the cost of the operation of inserting in the worst case.
either to remove the minimum element from a binary mound I know that minimum element where it is at the zero position of the vector by definition, by the order property.
what i have to do is not to violate the structural property, what i do is i put the last data in the zero position, i put the last data in the zero position, and i update the size value, to reflect that this element is no longer there, ok.
but of course, having put this element up here, it does not meet the order property, well, therefore we have to use a process analogous to the rewinding but in the downward direction, that is we have to sink the gap until we find the correct position, that is, until the result is a binary mound.
for that, sinking is slightly more complicated than rebounding but not much more.
because we have to sink, we can sink in the direction of either of the two sons but to ensure that the order property of a minimal mound is fulfilled, this hollow I always have to sink in the direction of the younger son.
notice how when sinking the gap in the direction of the youngest child, above I always have the smallest data.
in this way I always fulfill the property of order.
let's see an example, imagine that we want to remove the minimum element from the next mound, to guarantee the structural property, what would do is the last element I put it up and eliminate it.
and notice that what I have left, is not a binary mound, because it does not fulfill the property of order and now I have to start sinking.
always sink in the direction of the younger son, remember.
what is the youngest son of thirty-one, fourteen, or sixteen?
fourteen, therefore sunken, sunken means that swap the fourteen will come up to me and the thirty-one below, notice the fourteen above and the thirty-one below.
now follow the process I look for the youngest son, the nineteen.
as this is smaller than the father then plunged in the direction of the younger son.
nineteen here and thirty-one below.
again I look at the younger son of the two, the twenty-six, and since the twenty-six is smaller than the thirty-one, he must go up because if he did not fulfill the ordination property.
notice that we have already managed to sink this element until there is no more, well.
and the end result, this is a binary mound that fulfills the ordination property, therefore, note that rewinding and sinking processes are key to restoring order property on a mound.
well, as conclusions to comment that the binary mound is a data structure, which among other things allows to obtain the minimum element of a group in constant time, I always know where that minimum is, in the zero position.
I use a complete binary tree to ensure that its height is of the logarithm order on the basis of two of the number of elements, and when using an implicit representation, note that it does not imply an overcost of memory.
finally also comment that the binary mound is used in applications that require functionality based on the priority queue model and there are also additional applications such as vector sorting based on the heapsort method.
well, for my part that is all and I hope that this object of learning has been useful to you, thank you very much.
Hello, my name is Germán Moltó, I am a professor in the department of computer systems and computing, and in this learning object I will talk about one of the most efficient data structures for data search, the hash table.
well, with this learning object, at the end it is intended that you can justify the need for the use of hash tables.
understand the operation of the main operations of a scatter table and their associated cost.
and know the main characteristics of a good hash function as well as understand, what is the problem of collisions and specific mechanisms for their resolution.
well, when I have a group of objects and I want to represent them in memory in some way, if we have an array.
an array requires a linear time proportional to the number of items to find an item.
but of course this happens because I don't know the exact point of the structure where the object is stored, but if I really had in any way some heuristic that would tell me for each of the objects the exact point in the structure where it should be stored and where it is located.
then in that case notice that the insertion operation and wanted would be very fast, because I would know exactly where I have to insert and where I have to look for the item.
but of course here it comes up, a lot of problems, for example how to choose the box in which each object should go, either because to do this you need a scatter function that must assign a number that we will call hash value to a certain object, and we can use that value to index the array.
but of course, what happens if that hash function returns such a large value to me that it exceeds the limits of the array?
well, there is no problem, because we know that we can use the module operation so that if I take any value and make it module of the length of the array that gives us an integer between zero and the length of the array minus one, that is, a value between the limits, within the limits of the array.
but of course, what happens if two different objects receive the same hash value, that is, if they must match the same entry in that vector?
well, that is what is known as a collision, and we will see efficient mechanisms for its resolution.
well, we focus now on the hash table, the hash table is a data structure that aims at inserting, searching and deleting items in constant time.
to do this what it involves is, the use of a scattering function that must be calculated in constant time and must be able to evenly distribute the objects along the table.
look here we have a group of objects, here we have a hash table and in this case we have an example of a hash function that is not distributing the elements correctly by the table, because there are many objects that are receiving the same input, many collisions are occurring.
note also that the hash table must be relatively large to reduce the probability of a collision, because note that in the extreme case that we had a single-entry hash table, to insert N data we would have N minus a collision.
that is, the first data is inserted well, but the rest provoke collisions.
here we have an example of that style, we have a set of objects and a small hash table, and even if the hash function distributes the elements well by the table, as the table is small, because in the end there are many collisions.
well therefore the hash table should have a relatively large size.
what is a collision?
a collision occurs when different objects give rise to the same hash index, that is, I have objects, ok, that are not equal, according to one criterion and receive the same hash value to enter into the table.
well, notice that it is complicated to avoid collisions, because we have said that the hash function must be calculated in constant time and therefore has no possibility to control which are the occupied and free boxes, therefore we will have to invent mechanisms to solve these collisions.
there are several ways, for example solving collisions by scanning, that is, if the hash function tells me a box that is already occupied, I try to look for another free position, for it the linear scan what it does is visit the next box, that is, see if the next box is free and if it is free performs the insertion, and if it does not visit the next box there until it finds a free box.
the quadratic exploration on the contrary what it does is that it goes visiting i square positions beyond the square that has caused collision, in that way it tries to let us walk away to find free squares.
it is important to note that the search process must follow the same sequence of boxes because if we did not insert an element and then we would not have mechanisms to find it.
another of the most important mechanisms, to solve collisions, perhaps the most used is the resolution by linked chain, that is, in each position of the table what I keep is a linked list, in which the elements whose hash value coincides are inserted.
look here we have an example.
the array is an array of linked lists, in which all these elements are those that have received the same hash value.
well, what do you think is the optimal size that those lists should have, the optimal average size that those lists should have to obtain a good efficiency?
right, if it 's one, if that average size is one, you know, what that means is that there have been few collisions, ok, there have been almost no collisions.
so that way it's much quicker to look for items because note that in the worst case, I could have a single box with a large list linked to all the items, and therefore look for an item there, what it would cost us is a linear cost with the size of the list.
let's see an example of using a hash table imagine that we want to insert those elements into a hash table and size ten and the function is X Module Ten, okay.
I would take element five, five module ten is five, i insert it into that linked list, ten module ten is zero, i would insert it into that box, there hasn 't been any collision yet, three module ten is three i insert it into square three.
fifteen module ten is five, as the square is occupied there is a collision and the resolution of collisions by linked chain what implies is that it is inserted in that linked list.
it would insert the twenty, twenty module ten produces a collision and nineteen module ten is nine, where collision no longer occurs.
note that the degree of occupancy or load factor of the hash table is the ratio between the number of elements and the capacity of the table is six per ten, and that degree of occupancy is very important, because it is shown that if the load factor, ie the degree of occupancy of the table is relatively high, the number of collisions increases significantly and this does is that it degrades the performance of the hash table.
that is, we move away from that constant cost we want for major operations.
for that there is a very simple solution that is to apply the rehashing, the rehashing what it does is that it increases the size of the table to reduce the load factor, but of course what it has to do is it involves re-reinserting the nodes because the hash function often depends on the size of the table.
but good as the main advantage is that it allows you to maintain a reduced load factor to reduce the probability of collision.
note that the hash table has some disadvantages, the main advantage is that it allows to carry out operations in constant time but in return, on the other hand, note that to store N data we need a table of size much larger than N so that the probability of collision is quite low.
in addition, it is not possible to calculate the minimum element, nor the maximum, with an asymptotic temporal cost lower than linear.
but if our application does not need this feature then there is no problem, and it is also not possible to obtain an ordered sequence of its elements in asymptotic linear time cost with the number of inputs.
well as a conclusion I would like to emphasize that hash tables allow the average cost of operations, ie insert, search, delete is constant but watch out, provided that the load factor is not excessive to reduce the probability of collision.
and in addition, the hash function must be chosen very carefully, because it must be easily calculable, must be computable in constant time and must distribute the values well among all the components of the table.
and as main application examples of scatter tables I would like to highlight three, spell checkers, compiler symbol tables and dictionaries, are applications in which the hash table is widely used.
well and with this we finished the object of learning and I hope it has been useful to you, thank you very much.
